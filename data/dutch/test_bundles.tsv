""Do you know,"" he continued, "" that we have not yet paid that doctor's bill ? . . ."""" Oh ! that is very hard ! """" Dear Max, we live so economically here, we shall soon be able to pay all : moreover, you will certainly soon be appointed Resident, and then all will be arranged in a little time."""" That is exactly the thing that makes me sad,"" said Havelaar."" I should be so unwilling to leave Lebak. . . .I will explain that to you.Don't you believe that we loved our Max more after his illness ?Now, it appears to me that I shall love poor Lebak still more, after it has recovered from the cancer from which it has suffered for so many years."	droogstoppel

"" All will be right, Max !even if you had to go from here, then you could help Lebak afterwards on being made Governor-General."" Then came wild lines in Havelaar's pattern---there was anger in those flowers, . . .those strips were sharp, angular, crossing each other. . . .Tine understood that she had said something wrong. """" she began kindly. ""A curse on it ! . . .Will you have them starve so long?Can you live on sand?"""	droogstoppel
75	75	"""Dear Max! ..."" But he jumped up from his chair, and there was no more drawing that evening.He went up and down in the inner gallery, and at last he spoke in a tone which would have sounded rough and hard to every stranger, but which was thought of quite differently by Tine. ""A curse on this indifference, this shameful indifference !Here I have waited a month for justice, and meanwhile the poor people are suffering terribly.The Regent seems  to calculate upon nobody daring to take it up against him —look....""He went into his office, and came hack with a letter in his hand, a letter which lies before me, reader ! ""Look, in this letter, he dares to make me proposals about the kind of labour which he intends to have done by men whom he has summoned unlawfully .... is not that shamelessness going too far ?And do you know who these persons are ?They are women with little children, with sucklings ; women who are pregnant, who have been driven from Parang-Koodjang to the capital, to work for him---there are no more men !"	droogstoppel
76	76	"And they have nothing to eat, and they sleep on the road, and eat sand ....Can you eat sand ?Must they eat sand till I am Governor-General ? ""Curse it ! ...."" Tine knew very well with whom alone Max was angry, when he spoke thus to her whom he loved. ""And,"" continued Havelaar, "" that is all on my responsibility.If at this moment some of these poor creatures are wandering there outside, and seeing the light of our lamps, will say : ' There lives the wretch who ought to protect us ; there he sits quietly with wife and child, and draws embroidery patterns, while we lie here like dogs on the road, and starve with our children !'Yes, I hear it, I hear it ; that cry for vengeance upon my head ! . . . .here, Max, here !....And he kissed the child with a wildness which frightened it."	droogstoppel
77	77	""" My child, if they tell you that I am a wretch, who had no courage to do justice, that so many mothers have died hy my fault ; if they tell you that the neglect of your father stole away the bliss of your life ....Max, bear witness how I suffered !""And he burst into tears, which Tine kissed away.Then she put little Max to bed—a mat of straw—and when she returned found Havelaar in conversation with Verbrugge and Duclari, who had just come in.The conversation was about the expected decision of the Government."" I understand very well that the Resident is in a difficult position,"" said Duclari."" He cannot advise the Government to accept your proposals, for then too much would be brought to light.I have been long in Bantam, and know much about it,—more than you, Mr. Havelaar !I was here as sub-lieutenant, and in that position one hears things that the native does not dare to tell the functionaries.But if now, after an open investigation, all this comes to light, the Governor-General will summon the Resident to account for it, and ask him how it is that he has not discovered in two years what was obvious to you immediately?"	droogstoppel
78	78	"He must, therefore, prevent that investigation."" I have considered that,"" replied Havelaar, "" and put on my guard by his endeavours to move the Regent to  say something against me, which seems to show that he will try to remove the question, for instance, hy accusing me of....I know not what; I have covered myself against that by sending copies of my letters direct to the Government.In one of these letters, I beg to be called to account, if perhaps it should be pretended that I had done something wrong.If, now, the resident of Bantam attacks me, no decision can be made, according to justice before I have been heard-that is allowed even to a criminal—and I have done nothing wrong. ..."" "" There is the post!"" said Verbrugge.Yes, it was the post !-the post that brought the follow ing letter from the Governor- General of the Dutch Indies to Havelaar, late Assistant Resident of Lebak :— "" Official.—No."" BUITENZORG, 23d March 1856  "" The manner in which you have acted on the discovery "" or supposition of wrong-doing on the part of the chiefs "" in the district of Lebak, and your attitude towards your "" superior, the Resident of Bantam, have excited, in a high "" degree, my displeasure."	droogstoppel
79	79	"In your acts there is not only' - a want of the deliberate judgment, caution, and prudence - so indispensable to a functionary intrusted with power "" in the interior of Java (sic), but also notions of insubordination "" to your immediate superior.Only a few days "" after your appointment to your present office, you made "" the head of the native Government of Lebak the subject  of irritating examinations, without first consulting (sic) the Resident.In these examinations you found cause, without substantiating your accusations against that chief by facts (sic), much less by proofs, to make proposals which tended to subject a native functionary of the rank of the Regent of Lebak (a man of sixty years, but still a zealous servant, related to neighbouring influential "" Regents, and of whom favourable testimony has always "" been given) to a morally quite annihilating treatment. ""Moreover, you have, when the Resident did not feel "" inclined to give his consent to your proposals, refused to "" satisfy the just desire of your superior, that you should "" say openly what you knew of the actions of the native "" Government of Lebak."" Such conduct merits all disapprobation, and sanctions "" belief in your incapacity to bear office in the interior "" Government of Java.I am therefore obliged to dismiss "" you from your employment as Assistant Resident of "" Lebak. ""Yet, in consideration of the favourable reports received "" formerly of you, I have not found cause to deprive you "" of the prospect of again getting a situation in the "" Government of the interior.I have therefore given "" you the temporary appointment of Assistant Resident "" of Ngawie.On your behaviour in this office, it will "" entirely depend whether you remain a functionary in "" the service of the Government."" And beneath that stood the name of the man on whose "" zeal, capacity, and good faith"" the King said that he could rely, when he signed his appointment as Governor-General of the Dutch Indies."	droogstoppel
80	80	""" We go from here, dear Tine,"" said Havelaar ; and he gave the letter to Verbrugge, who read the document with Duclari.Verbrugge had tears in his eyes, but did not speak.Duclari, a very polite and well-bred man, burst out with a wild curse.G---, I have seen rogues and thieves in the Government here, . . ."" they have gone from here with honours, "" and to you they write such a letter!"""" It is nothing,"" said Havelaar ; "" the Governor-General "" is an honest man, ... he must be deceived ; though he "" could have guarded himself against that deceit, by first "" hearing me.But I will go to him, and show him how "" matters stand here ... he will do justice, I am certain of it. ""But if you go to Ngawie . ."" "" I know this for certain.The Regent of Ngawie is related to "" the Regent of Bantam."	droogstoppel
81	81	"I should have to do the same at "" Ngawie that I have done here : that would be a useless journey. ""Moreover, it was impossible for me to serve the trial as "" if I had behaved ill ... .and, finally, I see that to put "" an end to all this deceit, I can no longer be a functionary.As functionary, there are too many persons between me and the Government who have an interest in denying the misery of the population.There are other reasons that prevent me from going to Ngawie.There was no vacancy there ; there has been one made for me Look here ! ""And he showed in the Javanese newspaper, which had come by the same post, that indeed, in the same decree of the Government whereby he was appointed Assistant Resident of Ngawie, the Assistant Resident of that place was appointed to another district where there was a vacancy. ""Do you know why I have to go to Ngawie, and not to the district where there was a vacancy ?"" I will tell you-the Resident of Madioen, to which Ngawie belongs, is the brother-in-law of the late Resident of Bantam.I have said that such scandalous things went on here,---that the Regent had had such bad examples . . ."""	droogstoppel
82	82	""" Ah,"" cried Verbrugge and Duclari at the same time.They understood why Havelaar was transferred to Ngawie in particular, to be tried if he would perhaps correct himself. ""And there is still another reason why I cannot go there,"" said he.""The present Governor-General will soon resign,-I do not know his successor, nor what I may expect of him.In order to do something in time for  those poor people, I must speak to the present Governor before his departure, and if I went now to Ngawie, that would be impossible ...."" Dear Max ! """" You have courage, have you not ? ""you know I have courage when I am with you.""""Good!""He went and wrote the following, in his own opinion an example of eloquence :— "" RANKAS-BETONG, 29th March 1856."	droogstoppel
83	83	" "" To the Governor- General of the Dutch Indies."" I have had the honour to receive the official letter of "" your Excellency of the 23d inst.,No. 54.In reply to "" that document, I feel constrained to beg your Excellency "" to grant me an honourable discharge from the service of "" the Government.(Signed)  "" Max Havelaar.""  It needed not so long a time at Buitenzorg to grant the asked-for discharge, as was needed to decide how Havelaar's accusation could be turned away.For the latter a month was required, and the news of the discharge arrived in a few days at Lebak. ""God be praised,"" said Tine, ""that you can be your own self at last.Havelaar received no instructions to surrender the Government to Verbrugge ; he therefore awaited his successor."	droogstoppel
84	84	"The latter was a long time in coming, because he had to travel from a remote corner of Java.After wait ing three weeks, the ex-officio Assistant Resident of Lebak, who had, however, still acted as such, wrote the following letter to the Controller Verbrugge :— ""No. 153. ""Rankas-Betong, 15th April 1856. "" To the Controller of Lebak."" You know that I have received at my own request an "" honourable discharge from the service of the Government "" by decree of 4th inst.,No. 4.Perhaps I should have "" acted rightly, if, on the receipt of this decree, I had resigned "" my office of Assistant Resident immediately ; as "" it seems to be an anomaly to fulfil a function without "" being a functionary.Yet I received no instructions to surrender my office, "" and partly from the idea of the obligation not to leave "" my post without being duly relieved, partly from causes "" of subordinate interest, I waited for the arrival of my "" successor, thinking that that functionary would arrive "" soon, at least this month."" Now I hear from you that my successor may not be  "" expected so soon---you have, as I think, heard this "" news at Sevang,—and at the same time that the Resident "" was astonished that I, in the very peculiar position in "" which I am, have not yet asked to be allowed to transfer "" the Government to you.Nothing could be more agreeable to me "" than this news, for I need not assure you, "" that I, who have declared myself unable to serve otherwise "" than I have done, who have been punished for this "" way of serving with censure, with a ruinous and discreditable "" transfer, with an order to betray the poor "" men who confided in my good faith, with the choice also "" between dishonour and starvation .... that I had to "" consider with pains and care, everything if it was in "" harmony with my duty, and that the most simple matter "" was difficult for me, placed as I was between my conscience "" and the principles of the Government, to which "" I owe fidelity as long as I am not freed from my functions."	droogstoppel
85	85	""" This difficulty showed itself principally in the "" reply which I had to give to plaintiffs."" I had once promised to betray nobody to the rancour "" of his chiefs ;—once I had, imprudently enough, given "" my word for the justice of the Government."" The poor population could not know that this promise "" and this bail had been denied, and that I, poor and impotent, "" stood alone with my desire for justice and humanity. ""And people went on complaining.It was painful,  "" after the receipt of the missive of 23d March, to sit there "" as a supposed refuge, as a powerless protector."" It was heart-rending to hear the complaints of ill—treatment, "" extortion, poverty, hunger, whilst I myself "" had, with a wife and child, to meet hunger and poverty ! ""Neither could I betray the Government.I might not "" say to these poor people : ' Go and suffer, for it is the "" will of the Government that you should suffer extortion.'"" I might not avow my impotence, one as it was with the "" shame and unconscionableness of the Governor-General's "" counsellors."" Here is what I replied : "" ' I cannot help you immediately, but I will go to "" Batavia ; I will speak to the Governor about your "" misery."	droogstoppel
86	86	"He is just, and he will assist you.Go now "" quietly to your home ; do not oppose, do not remove— "" wait patiently : I think, ....I hope that justice will "" be done!'"" So I thought, ashamed as I was of the violation of my "" promise of help, to bring my ideas in harmony with my "" duty to the Government, which pays me still this month, "" and I would have continued thus till the arrival of my "" successor, if a particular occurrence had not obliged me "" to-day to put an end to this equivocal position.Seven "" persons had complained.I gave them the above-mentioned reply."" They returned to their homes.The district chief met them on the way. ""He must have forbidden them to leave their village again, and taken "" away (as I am told) their clothes, to oblige them to remain at home."" One of them escaped, came to me again and declared ' that he did not "" dare to return to his village. '"	droogstoppel
87	87	"""What I ought to reply to this man, I did not know.I could not protect him ; --I might not avow my impotence ; I would not prosecute the accused chief, because this would have appeared as if the matter had been picked by me, pour le besoin de macause I did not know what to do.....I charge you, until further instructions from the Resident of Bantam, with the Government of the district of Lebak, from to-morrow morning.-The Assistant Resident of Lebak, (Signed) ""MAX HAVELAAR.""Then Havelaar departed with wife and child from Rankas-Betong.He refused all escort.Duclari and Verbrugge were deeply touched at the leave-taking.Max was likewise moved ; above all, when he found at the first stage a great number of persons who had gone secretly from Rankas-Betong to bid him a last farewell.At Serang,the family was received into the house of Mr. Slymering, with the ordinary Indian hospitality."	droogstoppel
88	88	"In the evening many visitors came to the Resident.They said they had come to say farewell to Havelaar, and Havelaar received many an eloquent shake of the hand ...   But he had to go to Batavia to speak to the Governor-General.When they arrived there, he sought for an audience.This was refused him, because his Excellency had a pain in his foot.Havelaar waited till the foot was cured.Then he again sought an audience.His Excellency "" had so much to do that he had been obliged to refuse an audience even to the Director-General of Finance, and could not see Havelaar.""Havelaar waited till his Excellency should have struggled through all this ; meanwhile he felt something like jealousy for the persons who had to help his Excellency in his labour, for he liked to work quickly and hard, and generally so much business disappeared under his hand.This was, however, out of the question."	droogstoppel
89	89	"Havelaar's labour was heavier than labour. ...At last he again sought an audience.He received an answer that his Excellency could not see him, as he had too much to do, being on the point of departure.Max sought the favour of his Excellency to be heard for half-an-hour as soon as there should be some space between two "" businesses.""At last he heard that his Excellency would depart the next day !That was a thunderbolt for him.Still he believed with spasmodic energy that the resigning Governor was an honest man, and had been deceived.A quarter of an hour would have sufficed to prove the justice of his cause, and it appeared that this quarter of an hour would not be granted him.I find among Havelaar's papers the copy of a letter which he seems to have written to the retiring Governor-General, on the last evening before his departure to the mother country.In the corner I find the words written in pencil "" not exact"" which gives me to understand that some phrases were changed in copying."	droogstoppel
90	90	"I make this observation in order that no doubt may arise regarding the authenticity of the other official documents which I have communicated, and which have all been signed by another hand for exact copy ; I mention this, because of the want of literal conformity with this document.Perhaps he to whom this letter was addressed may feel inclined to make public the exact text ; then one may see how far Havelaar deviated from this copy. "" Batavia, 23d May 1856. "" Your Excellency,—My official request, by missive "" of 28th February, to be heard on the affairs of Lebak, "" has remained unanswered."" Neither has your Excellency thought fit to grant my "" repeated request for an audience."" A functionary, who was ' favourably known to the "" Government ' (I quote your Excellency's own words),  "" —one who has served his country in these regions for "" seventeen years,—one who not only never neglected his "" duty, but who conceived what was good with unexampled "" self-sacrifice, and who chose to sacrifice all for honour "" and duty,—such a one your Excellency has placed beneath the "" criminal, for the criminal is at least heard."" That they have deceived your Excellency with regard "" to me, I understand,—but that your Excellency did not "" catch the opportunity to escape from this deceit, I do "" not understand.To-morrow your Excellency goes from "" here, and I may not let you depart without having said "" once more that I did my duty,—only my duty,—with "" judgment, with calmness, with humanity, with moderation, and with courage.The grounds on which is based the censure contained "" in your Excellency's missive of 23d March are entirely "" invented and false.I can prove this, and it would have "" been proved already, if your Excellency had granted me "" half-an-hour's interview, if your Excellency could have "" found half-an-hour to do justice."	droogstoppel
91	91	"This you could not ; and an honest family has been "" ruined."" Yet I do not complain of this.

321	321	The tiger lay there with his belly torn open, and Saidjah was saved.Certainly there had been ' ontong ' in the ' oeser-oeseran ' of the buffalo.When this buffalo had also been taken away from Saidjah's father and slaughtered....I told you, reader, that my story is monotonous.When this buffalo was slaughtered, Saidjah was just twelve, and Adinda was wearing ' sarongs,' and making figures on them.She had already learned to express thoughts in melancholy drawings on her tissue, for she had seen Saidjah very sad.And Saidjah's father was also sad, but his mother still more so ; for she had cured the wound in the neck of the faithful animal which had brought her child home unhurt, after having thought, by the news of Adinda's brothers, that it had been taken away by the tiger.As often as she saw this wound, she thought how far the claws of the tiger, which had entered  so deeply into the coarse flesh of the buffalo, would have penetrated into the tender body of her child ; and every time she put fresh dressings on the wound , she caressed the buffalo, and spoke kindly to him , that the good faithful animal might know how grateful a mother is.Afterwards she hoped that the buffalo understood her, for then he must have understood why she wept when he was taken away to be slaughtered, and he would have known that it was not the mother of Saïdjah who caused him to be slaughtered .Some days afterwards Saïdjah's father fled out of the country ; for he was much afraid of being punished for not paying his land- taxes, and he had not another heirloom to sell, that he might buy a new buffalo, because his parents had always lived in Parang -Koodjang, and had therefore left him but few things.	stern
322	322	The parents of his wife too lived in the same district.However, he went on for some years after the loss of his last buffalo, by working with hired animals for ploughing ; but that is a very ungrateful labour, and moreover, sad for a person who has had buffaloes of his own.Saïdjah's mother died of grief, and then it was that his father, in a moment of dejection, fled from Bantam , in order to endeavour to get labour in the Buitenzorg districts.But he was punished with stripes , because he had left Lebak without a passport, and was brought back by the police to Badoer.There he was put in prison, because  he was supposed to be mad, which I can readily believe, and because it was feared that he would run amuck in a moment of mata-glap.But he was not long in prison, for he died soon afterwards.What became of the brothers and sisters of Saidjah I do not know.The house in which they lived at Badoer was empty for some time, and soon fell down ; for it was only built of bamboo, and covered with atap.A little dust and dirt covered the place where there had been much suffering.There are many such places in Lebak.	stern
323	323	Saidjah was already fifteen years of age, when his father set out for Buitenzorg ; and he did not accompany him thither, because he had other plans in view.He had been told that there were at Batavia many gentlemen, who drove in bendies, and that it would be easy for him to get a post as bendieboy, for which generally a young person is chosen, so as not to disturb the equilibrium of the two-wheeled carriage by too much weight behind.He would, they told him, gain much in that way if he behaved well,—perhaps he would be able to spare in three years money enough to buy two buffaloes.This was a smiling prospect for him.With the proud step of one who has conceived a grand idea, he,  after his father's flight, entered Adinda's house , and communicated to her his plan.“ Think of it,” said he, “ when I come back we shall be old enough to marry, and shall possess two buffaloes ! ”Very well, Saïdjah, I will gladly marry you when you return .I will spin and weave sarongs and slendangs, and be very diligent all the time.”“ Oh, I believe you , Adinda, but ... if I find you married ? '“ Saïdjah, you know very well that I shall marry no-body but you ; my father promised me to your father .”	stern
324	324	"""And you yourself ?”“ I shall marry you, you may be sure of that.”“ When I come back , I will call from afar off.”""Who shall hear it, if we are stamping rice in the village ? ""  ""That is true, ... but , Adinda, ...oh yes, this is better, wait for me under the djati wood, under the ketapan where you gave me the melatti.""“ But, Saïdjah, how can I know when I am to go to the ketapan ? ”  Saidjah considered and said : — "" Count the moons ; I shall stay away three times twelve moons, . . .this moon not included. . . .See, Adinda, at every new moon, cut a notch in your rice-block.When you have cut three times twelve lines, I will be under the Ketapan the next day, ... do you promise to be there?"""	stern
325	325	""" Yes, Saidjah, I will be there under the ketapan, near the djati-wood, when you come back.Hereupon Saidjah tore a piece off his blue turban, which was very much worn, and gave the piece of linen to Adinda to keep it as a pledge ; and then he left her and Badoer.He walked many days.He passed Rankas-Betong, which was not then the capital of Lebak, and Warong-Goonoong, where was the house of the Assistant Resident, and the following day saw Pamarangang, which lies as in a garden.The next day he arrived at Serang, and was astonished at the magnificence and size of the place, and the number of stone houses covered with red tiles.Saidjah had never before seen such a thing.He remained there a day, because he was tired ; but, during the night, in the coolness, he went further, and the following day, before the shadow had descended to his lips, though he wore the large toodoong which his father had left him, he arrived at Tangerang.At Tangerang he bathed in the river near the passage, and rested in the house of an acquaintance of his father's,  who showed him how to make straw-hats like those that come from Manilla.He stayed there a day to learn that, because he thought to be able to get something by that afterwards, if he should perhaps not succeed at Batavia.The following day towards the evening when it was cool he thanked his host very much, and went on."	stern
326	326	As soon as it was quite dark, when nobody could see it, he brought forth the leaf in which he kept the ' melatti ' which Adinda had given him under the ' Ketapan ' tree, for he was sad because he should not see her for so long a time.The first day, and the second day likewise, he had not felt so much how lonely he was, because his soul was quite captivated by the grand idea of gaining money enough to buy two buffaloes, and his father had never possessed more than one ; and his thoughts were too much concentrated in the hope of seeing Adinda again, to make room for much grief at his leave-taking.He took that leave in anxious hope, and mingled the memory of it in his thoughts, with the prospect of again seeing Adinda at last under the ketapan.For this prospect so occupied his heart that he, on leaving Badoer, and passing that tree, felt something like joy, as if the thirty-six moons were already past that separated him from that moment.It had appeared to him as if he had only to turn round, as if on his return from the journey, to see Adinda waiting for him under the tree.But the further he went away from Badoer, the more attention he paid to the duration of one  day, the longer he thought the period of the thirty-six moons before him.There was something in his soul which made him walk less quickly— he felt affliction in his knees, and though it was not dejection that overcame him, yet it was mournfulness, which is not far from it.He thought of returning ;—but what would Adinda think of so little heart ?Therefore he walked on, though less rapidly than the first day.He had the ' melatti ' in his hand, and often pressed it to his breast.	stern
327	327	"He had become much older during the last three days, and he no longer understood how he had lived so calmly before, when Adinda was so near him, and he could see her as often as he liked.But now he could not be calm, when he expected that he should see her again by and by.Nor did he understand why he after having taken leave had not returned once more to look at her again.And he even remembered how a short time ago he had quarrelled with her about the cord which she had made for the lalayang of her brother, and which had broken because there was a defect in her work by which a wager had been lost against the children of Tjipoeroet."" How was it possible,"" he thought, "" to have been angry about that with Adinda ?For if there was a defect in the cord, and if the wager of Badoer against  Tjipoeroet had been lost in consequence, and not by the piece of glass which little Djamien had thrown while hiding himself behind the pagger, ought I then to have been so rough to her, and called her by unseemly names ?What if I die at Batavia without having asked her pardon for such harshness ?Will it not make me appear as if I were a bad man, who scolds a girl ?And when it is heard that I have died in a foreign country, will not every one at Badoer say, ' It is good that Saidjah died ; for he had an insolent mouth against Adinda ? ""Thus his thoughts took a course which differed much from their former buoyancy, and involuntarily were uttered, first in half words and softly, soon in a monologue, and at last in the melancholy song, of which a translation follows."	stern
328	328	"My first intention was to have recourse to measure and rhyme in this translation ; but, like Havelaar, I thought it better to leave it without the corset."" I do not know where I shall die.I saw the great sea on the south-coast, when I was there with my father making salt ; If I die at sea, and my body is thrown into the deep water, then sharks will come : They will swim round my corpse, and ask, ' Which of us shall devour the body, that goes down into the water?'I shall not hear it !"" I do not know where I shall die.I saw in a blaze the house of Pa-ansoe, which he himself has set on fire because he was mala-glap ; If I die in a burning house, glowing embers will fall on my corpse ; And outside the house there will be many cries of men throwing water on the fire to kill it ;— I shall not hear it !"" I do not know where I shall die.I saw the little Si-Oenah fall out of a klappa-tree, when he plucked a klappa1 for his mother ; If I fall out of a klappa-tree I shall lie dead below, in the shrubs, like Si-Oenah.Then my mother will not weep, for she is dead.But others will say with a loud voice : ' See, there lies Saidjah.'"	stern
329	329	"I shall not hear it !"" I do not know where I shall die.I have seen the corpse of Pa-lisoe, who died of old age ; for his hairs were white : If I die of old age, with white hairs, hired women will stand weeping near my corpse ; And they will make lamentation, as did the mourners over Pa-lisoe's corpse ; and the grandchildren will weep, very loud ; I shall not hear it !""I do not know where I shall die.I have seen at Badoer many that were dead.They were dressed in white shrouds, and were buried in the earth ; If I die at Badoer, and I am buried beyond the dessah, eastward against the hill, where the grass is high ; Then will Adinda pass by there, and the border of her sarong will sweep softly along the grass, . . .I shall hear it.""  Saidjah arrived at Batavia.He begged a gentleman to take him into his service, which this gentleman did,  because he did not understand Saidjah's language; for they like to have servants at Batavia who do not speak Malay, and are, therefore, not so corrupted as others, who have been longer in connexion with Europeans.Saidjah soon learned Malay, but behaved well ; for he always thought of the two buffaloes which he should buy, and of Adinda.He became tall and strong, because he ate every day, what could not always be had at Badoer."	stern
330	330	He was liked in the stable, and would certainly not have been rejected, if he had asked the hand of the coachman's daughter.His master even liked Saidjah so much that he soon promoted him to be an indoor servant, increased his wages, and continually made him presents, to show that he was well pleased with his services.Saidjah's mistress had read Sue's novel, which for a short time was so popular : she always thought of Prince Djalma when she saw Saidjah, and the young girls, too, understood better than before how the Javanese painter, Radeen Saleh, had met with such great success at Paris.But they thought Saidjah ungrateful, when he, after almost three years of service, asked for his dismissal, and a certificate that he had always behaved well.This could not be refused, and Saidjah went on his journey with a joyful heart.He passed Pisang, where Havelaar once lived many years ago.But Saidjah did not know this, . . .and even  if he had known it, he had something else in his soul which occupied him. ...He counted the treasures which he was carrying home.In a roll of bamboo he had his passport and a certificate of good conduct.	stern
331	331	In a case, which was fastened to a leathern girdle, something heavy seemed to sling continually against his shoulder, but he liked to feel that. . . .And no wonder ! . . .this contained thirty piastres, enough to buy three buffaloes !What would Adinda say ?And this was not all.On his back could be seen the silver-covered sheath of the kris, which he wore in the girdle.The hilt was certainly very fine, for he had wound it round with a silk wrapper.And he had still more treasures !In the folds of the kahin round his loins, he kept a belt of silver links, with gold ikat-pendieng.It is true that the belt was short, but she was so slender. . . .	stern
332	332	And suspended by a cord round his neck, under his baadjoe, he wore a small silk bag, in which were some withered leaves of the ' melatti.'Was it a wonder that he stopped no longer at Sangerang than was necessary to visit the acquaintances of his father who made such fine straw hats ?Was it a wonder  that he said little to the girls on his road, who asked him where he came from, and where he was going—the common saluation in those regions ?Was it a wonder that he no longer thought Serang so beautiful, he who had learnt to know Batavia ?That he hid himself no more behind the ' pagger ' as he did three years ago, when he saw the Resident riding out ; for he had seen the much grander lord, who lives at Buitenzorg, and who is the grandfather of the Soosoohoonan (Emperor) of Solo ?Was it a wonder that he did not pay much attention to the tales of those who went a part of the way with him, and spoke of the news in Bantam-Kidool ; how the coffee culture had been quite suspended after much unrewarded labour ; how the district chief of Parang-Koodjang had been condemned to fourteen days' arrest at the house of his father-in-law for highway robbery ; how the capital had been removed to Rankas-Betong ; how a new Assistant Resident was there, because the other had died some months ago ; how this new functionary had spoken at the first Sebah meeting ; how for some time nobody had been punished for complaining; how the people hoped that all that had been stolen would be returned or paid for?No, he had sublime visions before his mind's eye.He sought for the ' Ketapan' tree in the clouds, as he was still too far off to seek it at Badoer.He caught at the air  which surrounded him, as if he would embrace the form which was to meet him under that tree.He pictured to himself the face of Adinda, her head, her shoulders ; he saw the heavy kondeh (chignon), so black and glossy, confined in a net, hanging down her neck ; he saw her large eye glistening in dark reflection ; the nostrils which she raised so proudly as a child, when he---how was it possible ?	stern
333	333	"---vexed her, and the corner of her lips, where she preserved a smile ; he saw her breast, which would now swell under the kabaai ; he saw how well the sarong of her own making fitted her hips, and descending along the thighs in a curve, fell in graceful folds on the small foot.No ; he heard little of what was told him.He heard quite different tones ; he heard how Adinda would say "" Welcome, Saidjah !I have thought of you in spinning and weaving, and stampiug the rice on the floor, which bears three times twelve lines made by my hand.Here I am under the ' Ketapan ' the first day of the new moon.Welcome, Saidjah, I will be your wife."" That was the music which resounded in his ears, and prevented him from listening to all the news that was told him on the road.At last he saw the ' Ketapan,' or rather he saw a large dark spot, which many stars covered, before his eye.That must be the wood of Djati, near the tree where he should see again Adinda, next morning after sunrise.He  sought in the dark, and felt many trunks-soon found the well-known roughness on the south side of a tree, and thrust his finger into a hole which Si-Panteh had cut with his parang to exorcise the pontianak who was the cause of his mother's toothache, a short time before the birth of Panteh's little brother."	stern
334	334	That was the Ketapan he looked for.Yes, this was indeed the spot where he had looked upon Adinda for the first time with quite a different eye from his other companions in play, because she had for the first time refused to take part in a game which she had played with other children-boys and girls-only a short time before.There she had given him the ' melatti.'He sat down at the foot of the tree, and looked at the stars; and when he saw a shooting-star he accepted it as a welcome of his return to Badoer, and he thought whether Adinda would now be asleep, and whether she had rightly cut the moons on her rice floor.It would be such a grief to him if she had omitted a moon, as if thirty-six were not enough ! . . .And he wondered whether she had made nice ' sarongs ' and 'slendangs ?'And he asked himself, too, who would now be dwelling in her father's house ?And he thought of his youth, and of his mother; and how that buffalo had saved him from the tiger, and he thought of what would have become of Adinda if that buffalo had  been less faithful !He paid much attention to the sinking of the stars in the west, and as each star disappeared in the horizon, he calculated how much nearer the sun was to his rising in the east, and how much nearer he himself was to seeing Adinda.For she would certainly come at the first beam---yes, at daybreak she would be there, . . .	stern
335	335	Why had not she already come the day before ?It pained him, that she had not anticipated the supreme moment which had lighted up his soul for three years with inexpressible brightness ; and, unjust as he was in the selfishness of his love, it appeared to him that Adinda ought to have been there waiting for him, who complained before the time appointed, that he had to wait for her.And he complained unjustly, for neither had the sun risen, nor had the eye of day cast a glance on the plain.The stars, it is true, were growing pale up there !ashamed as they were of the approaching end of their rule ; strange colours were flowing over the tops of the mountains, which appeared darker as they contrasted sharply with places more brightly illuminated; here and there flowed something glowing in the east—arrows of gold and of fire that were shot hither and thither, parallel to the horizon ;—but they disappeared again, and seemed to fall down behind the impenetrable curtain, which hid the day from the eyes of Saidjah.Yet it grew lighter and lighter around him— he now saw the landscape, and could  already distinguish a part of the Klappa-wood behind which Badoer lay :—there Adinda slept.No! surely she did not sleep ; how could she sleep ? . .Did she not know that Saidjah would be awaiting her?She had not slept the whole night certainly ; the night police of the village had knocked at her door to ask, why the pelitat (Javanese lamp) continued burning in her cottage ; and with a sweet laugh she had said, that a vow kept her awake to weave the ' slendang,' in which she was occupied, and which must be ready before the first day of the new moon.Or she had passed the night in darkness, sitting on the rice floor and counting with her eager finger, that indeed thirty-six deep lines were cut near each other.	stern
336	336	And she had amused herself with an imaginary fright as to whether she had miscalculated, perhaps had counted one less, to enjoy again and again, and every time, the delicious assurance, that without fail three times twelve moons had passed since Saidjah saw her for the last time.And now that it was becoming light, she too would be exerting herself with useless trouble, to bend her looks over the horizon to meet the sun, the lazy sun, that stayed away .... stayed away. . . .There came a line of bluish-red, which touched the clouds and made the edges light and glowing ;—and it began to lighten, and again arrows of fire shot through the atmosphere; but this time they did not disappear,  they seized upon the dark ground, and communicated their blaze in larger and larger circles, meeting, crossing, unrolling, turning, wandering, and uniting in patches of fire and lightnings of golden lustre on the azure ground . . .there was red, and blue, and silver, and purple, and yellow, and gold, in all this ...that was the daybreak, that was seeing Adinda again !Saidjah had not learnt to pray, and it would have been a pity to teach him ; for a more holy prayer, more fervent thanksgiving than was in the mute rapture of his soul, could not be conceived in human language.He would not go to Badoer—to see Adinda in reality seeming to him less pleasurable than the expectation of seeing her again.He sat down at the foot of the ' Ketapan,' and his eyes wandered over the scenery.Nature smiled at him, and seemed to welcome him as a mother welcoming the return of her child, and as she pictures her joy by voluntary remembrance of past grief, when showing what she has preserved as a keepsake during his absence.So Saidjah was delighted to see again so many spots that were witnesses of his short life.	stern
337	337	"But his eyes or his thoughts might wander as they pleased, yet his looks and longings always reverted to the path which leads from Badoer to the Ketapan tree.All that his senses could observe was called Adinda. ...He saw the abyss to the left, where the earth is so yellow, where once a young buffalo sank down into the depth,—they had descended with strong  rattan cords, and Adinda's father had been the bravest.Oh, how she clapped her hands, Adinda!And there, further on, on the other side, where the wood of cocoa-trees waved over the cottages of the village, there some where, Si-Oenah had fallen out of a tree and died.How his mother cried, ""because Si Oenah was still such a little one,"" she lamented, ... as if she would have been less grieved if Si-Oenah had been taller.But he was small, that is true, for he was smaller and more fragile than Adinda. . . .Nobody walked upon the little road which leads from Badoer to the tree.By and by she would come ... it was yet very early.Saidjah saw a badjing (squirrel) spring with playful nimbleness up the trunk of a cocoa-tree."	stern
338	338	"The graceful animal—the terror of the proprietor of the tree, but still lovely in form and movement—ran untiringly up and down.Saidjah saw it, and forced himself to stay and look at it, because this calmed his thoughts after their heavy labour since sunrise—rest after the fatiguing expectancy.Soon he uttered his impressions in words, and sang what his soul dictated him.I would rather read you his lay in Malay, that Italian language of the East :— "" See, how the ' badjing ' looks for his means of living On the Klappa-tree.He ascends, descends, wantons right and left, He turns (round the tree), springs, falls, climbs, and falls again.He has no wings, and yet he is as quick as a bird.Much happiness, my 'badjing,'—I give you hail !You will surely find the means of living which you seek ;But I am sittiug alone near the wood of Djati-trees  Waiting for the food of my heart."	stern
339	339	"Long has the small appetite of my badjing been sated ; Long has he returned to his little nest ;But still my soul And my heart are very sad . . . Still there was nobody on the path leading from Badoer to the Kelapan. . . .Saidjah caught sight of a butterfly which seemed to enjoy itself in the increasing warmth .... ""See how the butterfly flutters everywhere : His wings glisten like a flower of many colours ; His heart is in love with the blossoms of the kenari, Certainly he looks for his fragrant sweetheart.Much joy, my butterfly, — I give you hail !You will surely find what you seek ; But I am sitting alone near the Djati-wood, Waiting for what my heart loves : Long since has the butterfly kissed The kenari blossom which it loves so well ; But still my soulAnd my heart are very sad .... Adinda ! ""And still there was no one on the path leading from Badoer to the Ketapan.The sun began to rise high,—there was warmth in the air."	stern
340	340	""" See how the sun glitters on high, High above the waringi—hill !He feels too warm and wishes to descend, To sleep in the sea as in the arms of a spouse.  Much joy, O sun, —I give you hail !What you seek you will surely find ;But I sit alone by the Djati-wood Waiting for rest for my heart.Long the sun will have set And will sleep in the sea, when all is dark ; And still my soulAnd my heart will be very sad . . .And there was nobody on the road leading from Badoer to the Ketapan."" When no longer butterflies shall flutter about, When the stars shall no longer glitter, When the melatti shall no longer yields its perfume, When there shall be no longer sad hearts, Nor wild animals in the wood, When the sun shall go wrong And the moon forget the east and the west, If Adinda has not yet arrived, Then an angel with shining wings Will descend on earth, to look for what remained behind : Then my corpse shall be here under the ketapan— My soul is very sad,....There was nobody on the path leading from Badoer to the Ketapan. """	stern
341	341	Then my corpse will be seen by the angel, He will point it out with his finger to his brethren— ' See, a dead man has been forgotten, His rigid mouth kisses a melatti flower : Come, let us take him up to heaven, Him who has waited for Adinda, till he died, Surely, he may not stay behind alone, Whose heart had the strength to love so much,' Then my rigid mouth shall open once more.To call Adinda whom my heart loves, I will kiss the melatti once more.Which she gave me ....And still there was nobody on the path leading from Badoer to the Ketapan.she must have fallen asleep towards morning, tired of watching during the night, of watching for manynights :—she had not slept for weeks : so it was !Should he rise and go to Badoer !—No, that would be doubting her arrival.Should he call that man who was driving his buffalo to the field ? . . . .That man was too far off, and moreover, Saidjah would speak to no one about Adinda, would ask no one after Adinda ....He would see her again, he would see her alone, he would see her first.	stern
342	342	"Oh, surely, surely she would soon come !He would wait, wait ....But if she were ill, or ... .Like a wounded stag Saidjah flew along the path leading from the ' Ketapan' to the village where Adinda lived.He saw nothing and heard nothing; and yet he could have heard something, for there were men standing in the road at the entrance of the village, who cried— "" Saidjah, Saidjah !""But, .... was it his hurry, his eagerness, that prevented him from finding Adinda's house ?He had already rushed to the end of the road, through the village, and like one mad, he returned and beat his head, because he must have passed her house without seeing it.But again he was at the entrance of the village, and, ....Oh God, was it a dream ? . . .Again he had not found the house of Adinda."	stern
343	343	"Again he flew back and suddenly stood still, seized his head with both his hands to press away the madness that overcame him, and cried aloud— "" Drunk, drunk ; I am drunk !""And the women of Badoer came out of their houses, and saw with sorrow poor Saidjah standing there, for they knew him, and understood that he was looking for the house of Adinda, and they knew that there was no house of Adinda in the village of Badoer.For, when the district chief of Parang-Koodjang had taken away Adinda's father's buffaloes. . . .I told you, reader !that my narrative was monotonous.Adinda's mother died of grief, and her baby sister died because she had no mother, and had no one to suckle her.And Adinda's father, who feared to be punished for not paying his land-taxes. .I know, I know that my tale is monotonous..... had fled out of the country ; he had taken Adinda and her brothers with him.But he had heard how the father of Saidjah had been punished at Buitenzorg with stripes for leaving Badoer without a passport."	stern
344	344	And, therefore, Adinda's father had not gone to Buitenzorg, nor to the Preangan, nor to Bantam.He had gone to Tjilangkahan, the quarter of Lebak bordering on the sea.There he had concealed himself in the woods, and waited for the arrival of Pa Ento, Pa Lontah, Si Oeniah, Pa Ansive,  Abdoel Isma, and some others that had been robbed of their buffaloes by the district chief of Parang-Koodjang, and all of whom feared punishment for not paying their land-taxes.There they had at night taken possession of a fishing-boat, and had gone to sea.They had steered towards the west, and kept the country to the right of them as far as Java Head : then they had steered northwards till they came in sight of Prince's Island, and sailed round the east coast of that island, and from there to the Lampoons.Such at least was the way that people told each other in whispers in Lebak, when there was a question of buffalo robbery and unpaid land-taxes.But Saidjah did not well understand what they said to him ; he did not even quite understand the news of his father's death.There was a buzzing in his ears, as if a gong had been sounded in his head : he felt the blood throbbing convulsively through the veins of his temples, that threatened to yield under the pressure of such severe distension.He spoke not : and looked about as one stu pefied, without seeing what was round and about him; and at last he began to laugh horribly.An old woman led him to her cottage, and took care of the poor fool.	stern
345	345	"Soon he laughed less horribly, but still did not speak.But during the night the inhabitants of the hut were  frightened at his voice, when he sang monotonously : "" I do not know where I shall die,"" and some inhabitants of Badoer put money together, to bring a sacrifice to the bojajas of the Tji-Udjung for the cure of Saidjah, whom they thought insane.But he was not insane.For upon a certain night when the moon was very clear, he rose from the baleh-baleh, softly left the house, and sought the place where Adinda had lived.This was not easy, because so many houses had fallen down; but he seemed to recognise the place by the width of the angle which some rays of light formed through the trees, at their meeting in his eye, as the sailor measures by lighthouses and the tops of mountains.Yes, there it ought to be :—there Adinda had lived !Stumbling over half-rotten bamboo and pieces of the fallen roof, he made his way to the sanctuary which he sought.And, indeed, he found something of the still standing pagger, near to which the baleh-baleh of Adinda had stood, and even the pin of bamboo was still with its point in that pagger, the pin on which she hung her dress when she went to bed.....But the baleh-baleh had fallen down like the house, and  was almost turned to dust.He took a handful of it, pressed it to his opened lips, and breathed very hard. . . ."	stern
346	346	The following day he asked the old woman, who had taken care of him, where the rice-floor was which stood in the grounds of Adinda's house.The woman rejoiced to hear him speak, and ran through the village to seek the floor.When she could point out the new proprietor to Saidjah, he followed her silently, and being brought to the rice-floor, he counted thereupon thirty-two lines. . . .Then he gave the woman as many piastres as were required to buy a buffalo, and left Badoer.At Tjilangkahan, he bought a fishing-boat, and, after having sailed two days, arrived in the Lampoons, where the insurgents were in insurrection against the Dutch rule.He joined a troop of Badoer men, not so much to fight as to seek Adinda ; for he had a tender heart, and was more disposed to sorrow than to bitterness.One day that the insurgents had been beaten, he wandered through a village that had just been taken by the Dutch army, and was therefore in flames.Saidjah knew that the troop that had been destroyed there consisted for the most part of Badoer men.He wandered like a ghost among the houses, which were not yet burned down, and found the corpse of Adinda's father with a  bayonet-wound in the breast.Near him Saiidjah saw the three murdered brothers of Adinda, still boys—children, —and a little further lay the corpse of Adinda, naked, and horribly mutilated. . . .	stern
347	347	"A small piece of blue linen had penetrated into the gaping wound in the breast, which seemed to have made an end to a long struggle. . . .Then Saidjah went to meet some soldiers who were driving, at the point of the bayonet, the surviving insurgents into the fire of the burning houses ; he embraced the broad bayonets, pressed forward with all his might, and still repulsed the soldiers, with a last exertion, until their weapons were buried to the sockets in his breast.A little time afterwards there was much rejoicing at Batavia for the new victory, which so added to the laurels of the Dutch- Indian army.And the Governor wrote that tranquillity had been restored in the Lampoons ; the King of Holland, enlightened by his statesmen, again rewarded so much heroism with many orders of knighthood.And probably thanksgivings mounted to heaven from the hearts of the saints in churches and tabernacles, at the news that "" the Lord of hosts "" had again fought under the banner of Holland. . . ."" But God, moved with so much woe, Did not accept the sacrifices of that day ! ""  I have made the end of the history of Saidjah shorter than I could have done if I had felt inclined to paint something dreary.The reader will have observed how I lingered over the description of the waiting under the Ketapan, as if I was afraid of the sad catastrophe, and how I glided over that with aversion.And yet that was not my intention, when I began to speak about Saidjah.For I feared that stronger colours were requisite to move when describing such strange circumstances."	stern
348	348	Yet while writing I felt that it would be an insult to the reader to believe that I ought to have put more blood in my picture I could have done it, for I have documents before me . . .but no !—rather a confession.Yes ! a confession.I do not know whether Saidjah loved Adinda: I know not whether he went to Badoer, nor whether he died in the Lampoons by Dutch bayonets.I do not know whether his father died by being beaten with rods, because he left Badoer without a passport, I do not know whether Adinda counted the moons by lines in her rice-floor.All this I do not know.But I know more than all this.I know, and I can prove it, that there were many Adindas and many Saidjahs, and that what was fiction in one case, becomes truth generally speaking.I have already said that I can give the names of persons who, like the parents of Saidjah and Adinda, were driven away by oppression from their  country.It is not my intention to publish in this book communications such as would be suitable for a tribunal that had to decide on the manner in which the Dutch power is exercised in India,---communications that would have the power to convince him only who had patience enough to read them all, which cannot be expected of the public that looks for recreation in its reading.	stern
349	349	"Therefore instead of barren names of persons and places with the dates, instead of a copy of THE LIST OF THEFTS AND EXTORTIONS WHICH LIES BEFORE ME, I have tried to give a sketch of what can take place in the hearts of the poor people who are robbed of their means of subsistence ; or even, I have only made you guess this, as I feared to be mistaken in painting emotions which I never experienced.But as regards the main point ...O that I were summoned to prove what I wrote !O that it were said, "" You invented that Saidjah : he never sang that lay ; there never lived an Adinda in Badoer !O that it were said with the power and the will to do justice as soon as I have proved myself to have been no slanderer !Is there untruth in the parable of the Good Samaritan, because perhaps a plundered traveller was never taken to the Samaritan's house ?Is there untruth in the parable of the Sower, because it is clear that no husbandman will throw his seed on a rock ?or, to descend to more conformity with my book, can the main thing---truth---be  denied to "" Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" because there never existed an Evangeline ?Shall people say to the author of that immortal protest---immortal, not because of art or talent, but because of tendency and impression---shall they say to her, "" You have lied : the slaves are not illtreated ; for there is untruth in your book—it is a novel ? ""Had not she to give a tale, instead of an enumeration of barren facts, a tale which surrounded those facts, to introduce them into our hearts ?"	stern
350	350	"Would her book have been read if she had given it the form of a law-suit ?Is it her fault or mine, that truth, to find entrance, has so often to borrow the dress of a lie ?And to some who will pretend that I have too much idealized Saidjah and his love, I ask how they can know this ; as only very few Europeans have given themselves the trouble to stoop to observe the emotions of the coffee and sugar machines, called "" Natives.""But even if this observation were well founded, whosoever quotes this as a proof against the cardinal tendency of my book, gives me a complete triumph.For that observation when translated is as follows :—"" The evil which you combat does not exist, or not in such a high degree, because the native is not like your Saidjah : there is not in the ill-treatment of the Javanese so much evil as there would be if you had rightly drawn your Saidjah.The Soondanese do not sing such songs, do not love so, do not feel thus. . . ."" No, Colonial Ministers !no, Governors-General in retirement !you have not to prove that.You have to prove that the population is not ill-treated, whether there are sentimental Saidjahs amongst this population or not ; or should you dare to pretend that you may steal buffaloes of men who do not love, who do not sing melancholy songs, who are not sentimental ?"	stern
351	351	On an attack upon literary performances I should defend the exactness of the picture of Saidjah, but on political grounds I admit immediately all observations on this exactness, to prevent the great question from being removed to a wrong basis.It is quite indifferent to me whether I am thought to be an incapable painter, if it is only admitted that the ill-treatment of the native is EXCESSIVE ; that is the word on the notice of Havelaar's predecessor which he showed to the Controller Verbrugge: ---a notice which lies before me.But I have other proofs, and that is fortunate.For this predecessor of Havelaar could also have been mistaken.Alas, if he was mistaken, he has been very severely punished for his mistake !   Chapter XVIII   It was afternoon.Havelaar, coming out of his room, found Tine in the fore-gallery, waiting for him at the tea-table.Madam Slotering had just left her house, and seemed to have the intention of going to Havelaar's, but suddenly she went to the gate, and there, with very violent gestures, sent back a man who had just entered.She remained standing still till she felt sure that he had gone away, and then returned along the grass-field to Havelaar's.	stern
352	352	""" I will know at last what this means,"" said Havelaar ; and when the salutation was over he asked, jokingly, that she might not think he grudged her influence in grounds which formerly were hers : "" Now, Madam, do tell me why you always send back the men who come into the grounds.What if that man, for instance, had fowls to sell, or any other kitchen requisite?"" There was in the face of Madam Slotering a painful expression, which did not escape Havelaar's observation."" Ah,"" she said, "" there are so many bad men."""" Certainly, that is the case everywhere ; but if you are so particular, the good ones will stay away too.Come now, Madam, tell me why you keep such a sharp look-out over the grounds?""Havelaar looked at her, and endeavoured in vain to read the reply in her watery eyes.He again pressed for an explanation, and the widow burst into tears, saying that her husband had been poisoned at Parang-Koodjang, in the house of the district chief.He would do justice, Mr. Havelaar !"" continued the poor woman ; "" he wished to put an end to the oppression of the people.He exhorted and threatened the chiefs in councils and in writing ; you must have found his letters in the archives ..."	stern
353	353	""" That was the case : Havelaar had read those letters, of which I have copies before me. ""He spoke repeatedly to the Resident,"" continued the widow, "" but always in vain ; for as it was generally known that the extortion was for and under the protection of the Regent, whom the Resident would not complain of to the Government, all these conversations had no other effect than the ill treatment of the complainants.Therefore my poor husband had said that if no alteration should be made before the end of the year, he would apply direct to the Governor-General.That was in November.A few days later he made a journey of inspection, took his dinner  at the house of the Demang of Parang -Koodjang, and soon afterwards was brought home in a pitiable condition.He cried, while pointing to his stomach, ' Fire, fire,' and in a few hours he was dead ; he who had always been remarkable for good health."""" Did you send for the Serang doctor ?"" asked Havelaar.Yes, but my husband died soon after his arrival.I did not dare to tell the doctor my suspicion, because I foresaw that I should not be able soon to leave this place, and I feared revenge.I have heard that you, like my husband, oppose the abuses which reign here, and therefore I have not a moment's peace."	stern
354	354	"I would have concealed all this from you to avoid frightening you and Madam Havelaar, and so I only watched the grounds to prevent strangers from entering the kitchen."" Now it was clear to Tine why Madam Slotering had kept her own household, and would not even make use of the kitchen, which was so large.Havelaar sent for the Controller.Meanwhile he sent a request to the physician at Serang, to make a statement of the symptoms attending the death of Slotering.The reply which he received the next day to that request, was not in accordance with the widow's suspicions.According to the doctor, Slotering had died of "" an abscess in the liver."" I do not know whether such a disease can manifest itself suddenly, and cause death in a few hours.I think I must bear in mind the evidence of Madam Slotering, that her husband had  formerly been always healthy ; but if no value is attached to such evidence, because the notion of what is called health varies with different persons, particularly in the eyes of non-medical individuals, yet the important question remains, whether a person who dies to-day of an "" abscess in the liver,"" could ride on horseback yesterday, with the intention of inspecting a mountainous country, which is in some directions eighty miles in extent ?The doctor who treated Slotering may have been a skilful physician, and yet have been mistaken in his judgment of the symptoms of the disease, unprepared as he was to suspect crime.However this may be, I cannot prove that Havelaar's predecessor was poisoned, because Havelaar was not allowed time to clear up the matter ; but I can prove that every one believed in the poisoning, and that this was suspected on account of his desire to oppose injustice."	stern
355	355	"The Controller Verbrugge entered Havelaar's room ; the latter asked abruptly— "" What did Mr. Slotering die of?"""" I don't know."""" Was he poisoned ? """" I don't know ; . . . .but---"" "" Speak plainly, Verbrugge.""""

356	356	"To proceed, Is it true, or untrue, that much extortion is committed in Lebak?""Verbrugge made no reply. ""Answer me, Verbrugge !"""" I dare not."""" Write down that you dare not.""Verbrugge wrote it down ....it lies before me. ""Well, to proceed, you dare not answer the last question.You told me lately, when there was a question about poisoning, that you were the only support of your sisters at Batavia,— is that the reason of your fear, of what I always called your halfness ?""""Yes."""	stern
357	357	"Verbrugge wrote it down ....his declaration lies before me."" That will do,"" said Havelaar, "" I know enough.And Verbrugge left.Havelaar went out and played with little Max, whom he kissed very fervently.When Madam Slotering was gone, he sent away the child, and called in Tine."" Dear Tine !I have a favour to ask you.I should like you and Max to go to Batavia :—to-day I accuse the Regent.""She fell on his neck, for the first time opposed to his wishes, and cried, sobbing—  ""No, Max ; no, Max, I will not go..."	stern
358	358	"I will not go ; we eat and drink together. ""Was Havelaar wrong when he made out that she had as little right to blow her nose as the women at Arles?He wrote and despatched the letter of which I here present a copy.After I have given a slight sketch of the circumstances under which that letter was written, I believe that it is not necessary for me to show the circumspection which he observed, while not uttering a syllable of the discovery just made, not to weaken his positive accusation by the uncertainty of a very importantbut as yet unproved accusation.His intention was to exhume the corpse of his predecessor,and to havee it scientifically examined as soon as the Regent should have been removed, and his party made harmless ; but as I have already said, he was not allowed the opportunity of doing this.In the copies of official documents—copies which strictly conform with the originals—I think I may use single pronouns instead of the foolish titles.I expect that the good taste of my readers will approve of this change.  "" Rankas-Betong, 24th February 1856."" To the Resident of Bantam."	stern
359	359	"Since returning a month ago to my duties here, I have "" occupied myself principally in examining how the chiefs  "" discharge their obligations towards the population as "" regards statute-labour, poondootan, and suchlike."" I very soon discovered that the Regent, on his own "" responsibility, and for his advantage, summoned the "" population to work for him, far above the legally authorized "" number of pantjens or kemits."" I hesitated between the choice of sending at once an "" official report and the desire to make this native functionary "" change his policy by gentle means, or even "" afterwards by threats, in order to attain the double purpose of "" putting an end to abuse, and at the same time "" not acting too severely against this old servant of the "" Government, particularly considering the bad examples "" which, I believe, have often been set before him ; and in "" connexion with the peculiar circumstance that he expected a visit "" from two relations (the Regents of Bombang "" and Tjandoer, at least of the latter, who, as I hear, is "" already coming with a large train), and he being thus "" more than usually in temptation—and with regard to "" the critical embarrassment of his pecuniary circumstances, "" as it were obliged—to provide by unlawful "" means the necessary preparations for that visit  "" All this made me incline to moderation, with regard to "" what had already happened, but not at all to indulgence "" for the future."" I insisted upon the immediate cessation of every unlawful act."" I made you acquainted with that previous experiment "" to induce the Regent by moderation to do his duty. ""Yet it is evident to me that he casts all to the winds "" with rude insolence ; and I feel bound to communicate "" to you in virtue of my official oath; "" That I accuse the Regent of Lebak, Radeen Adhipatti, "" Karta Natta Negara, of abuse of power, by disposing "" unlawfully of the labour of his subordinates, and suspect "" him of extortion while exacting productions in natura, "" without payment, or for prices arbitrarily fixed : "" That I suspect, moreover, the Demang of Parang-Koodjang "" (the Regent's son-in-law) of complicity in the "" above-mentioned abuses.""

The next day the Resident of Bantam replied ? . . . .no, but "" Mr. Slymering "" did so, in a private letter.That reply is a precious contribution to the knowledge  of how the Government is carried on in Dutch India."	stern
361	361	"Mr. Slymering complained "" that Havelaar had not first communicated verbally to him the affair mentioned in the letter88,""—of course because then there would have been more chance of ""arranging"" matters ; adding, more over, that Havelaar "" disturbed him in pressing business !""The man was surely busy in writing the yearly report on tranquil tranquillity ....I have that letter before me, and do not trust my eyes.I read once more the letter of the Assistant Resident of Lebak ....I compare Havelaar and Slymering.This Shawlman is a low beggar.You must know, reader, that Bastianus is again very often absent from the office, because he has gout.Now, as I cannot reconcile it with my conscience to throw away the funds of the firm (Last and Co.)— for where principles are concerned, I am immoveable.I thought the day before yesterday that Shawlman wrote a good hand, and, as he looked so very poor, that he could therefore certainly be got for small wages."	stern
362	362	"I therefore thought that it was my duty to provide in the cheapest manner for the removal of Bastianus.I went accordingly to Shawlman's house in the Lange Leidsche Dwarsstraat.The woman of the shop was at the door, but she seemed not to recognise me, though I  had lately told her that I was Mr. Drystubble, coffeebroker, of the Laurier Canal.There is always a sort of insult in such a non-recognition ; but as it was now not so cold, and as I wore last time I was there my coat trimmed with fur, I ascribed it to that, and think nothing of it—I mean the insult.I said therefore again that I was Mr. Drystubble, of the Laurier Canal, coffee-broker, and begged her to go and see if Shawlman was in, because I did not wish, as on the last occasion, to have to speak to his wife, who is always discontented.But the woman refused to go up -stairs."" She could not walk up and down stairs the whole day for that beggarly family,"" said she, "" but I could go and look for myself.""And then followed again a description of the staircase and doors, which I had no need of ; for I always know a place where I have been once, because I pay such attention to everything.I have got accustomed to that in my business.So I went up-stairs, and knocked at the well-known door, which opened."	stern
363	363	I entered, and as I saw nobody in the room, I looked round.There was not much to be seen.A child's trousers with an embroidered stripe hung over a chair—why need such people wear embroidered trousers ?In a corner stood a not very heavy travelling box, which I lifted up by the hinge, and on the mantel-piece there were some books, which I looked at.A curious collection !A couple of volumes of Byron, Horace, Bastiat, Beranger, and, ... do guess ! . . .a Bible, a complete Bible, with  the Apocrypha.This I had not expected of Shawlman.It appeared also to have been read, for I found many notes on loose pieces of paper relating to the Scriptures, all written in the same handwriting as the pieces in that unwelcome parcel.Above all he seemed to have studied carefully the Book of Job, for there the leaves bore the marks of it.	stern
364	364	I think that he begins to feel the chastisement of the Lord, and will therefore reconcile himself to God by reading the Holy Scriptures, and I am not opposed to that.But while waiting, my eye caught sight of a lady's work-box which stood on the table.Without thinking about it, I looked at it : there were in it a pair of half-finished child's stockings, a lot of foolish verses, and a letter addressed to Shawlman's wife, as could be seen by the inscription.The letter was open, and it seemed as if it had been rumpled with some anger.Now it is a firm principle with me never to read anything that is not addressed to me, because I do not think it respectable.I never do such a thing when I have no interest in it ;—but now I got an inspiration that it was my duty to read this letter, because the contents would perhaps further me in the humane intentions that made me go to Shawlman.I thought about it, how the Lord is always near to those who believe in Him, as He gave me here quite unexpectedly an opportunity to know a little more about this man, and protected me too from the danger of performing an act of charity to an immoral person.I pay much attention to such directions of the Lord :— this has done me a great deal of good in business.With much surprise I saw that the wife of Shawlman belongs to a respectable family ; the letter at least was signed by a relation whose name in Holland is respected, and I was indeed in ecstasies with the beautiful contents of those lines.It appeared to be from a person who laboured zealously for the Lord ; for he wrote that the wife of Shawlman ought to be divorced from such a wretch, who made her suffer poverty,—who could not earn his livelihood, who was, moreover, a rascal, because he had debts.	stern
365	365	That the writer of the letter pitied her condition, though that condition was her own fault, because she had forsaken the Lord, and stuck to Shawlman ;—that she ought to return to the Lord, and that in that case her family would all of them assist her, and furnish her with needlework, but before all things she ought to put away this Shawlman, who was a disgrace to the family.In a word, you could not get in church itself more piety than was to be found in this letter.I knew enough, and was grateful to have been warned in such a miraculous way.Without this warning I should certainly have become a victim of my own good heart.I resolved, therefore, again to keep Bastianus till I could find a fitter person to take his place ; for I do not like to turn any one to the streets.The reader will be curious to know how I got on at the  Rosemeyers' last party.I was not there, .... wonderful things have happened !I had gone to Driebergen with my wife and Mary.My father-in-law, old Mr. Last, the son of the first Last (the Meyers were then still in the firm, but they have left it long ago), said some years ago that he should like to see my wife and Mary.	stern
366	366	Now, it was very fine weather, and my fear of the love-history with which Stern had menaced us, made me think all at once of this invitation.I spoke of it to our bookkeeper, who is a man of experience, and who, after mature deliberation, recommended me to sleep a night on it.This I intended immediately to carry out, for I am quick in the execution of my decisions.The following day I perceived already how wise this advice was, for during the night I got the idea that I could not do better than delay my decision till Friday.In a word, after having carefully considered all things,—there was much in favour of the plan, but also much against it,— we went on Saturday afternoon, and came back on Monday morning.I would not tell you all this, if it was not in connexion with my book.First of all I think it necessary that you should know why I do not protest against the nonsense which Stern certainly brought out last Sunday.(What nonsense is that about a person who would hear when he was dead ?Mary mentioned it to me : she had heard it from the Rosemeyers—who trade in sugar;) secondly, because I am now again convinced that all those stories about misery  and trouble in the East Indies are downright lies.Thus it may be seen how travelling gives a person the opportunity to penetrate deeply into affairs.	stern
367	367	Saturday evening, for instance, my father- in-law had accepted an invitation from a gentleman, who had been formerly a Resident in the East Indies, and who lives now at a large country-seat.We went there, and, indeed, I cannot sufficiently praise the excellent reception we met with.Our host sent his carriage to fetch us, and the coachman had on a red waistcoat.Now it was certainly a little too cold to inspect the country-seat, which must be magnificent in the summer, but in the house itself there was nothing to desire ; for it was replete with luxury: a billiard-room, a library, a covered iron and glass conservatory, and a cockatoo on a silver perch.I never saw such a thing.I made the observation, how good conduct is always rewarded ; that that man had been attentive to his business was evident, for he had more than three orders of knighthood.He had a beautiful country-seat, and, moreover, a house in Amsterdam.At the supper all was truffe, and even the servants who waited at table wore red waistcoats, like the coachman.As I take great interest in Indian affairs, because of the coffee, I began a conversation on the subject, and perceived very soon what I had to think about it.This Resident told me that he was always very well off in the East Indies, and that there was, therefore, not a word of  truth in those stories of discontent among the population.	stern
368	368	"I turned the conversation upon Shawlman.He knew him, and that unfavourably.He said that the Government had done well in dismissing him, for that this Shawlman was a very discontented person, who made remarks about everything, and there was, moreover, much to disapprove of in his own conduct.For instance, he was always running away with girls, and bringing them home openly before his wife ; he did not pay his debts, a thing which is very unseemly.As I knew so exactly from the letter I had read how well-founded this accusation was, I was very well pleased to find that I had judged of all so correctly, and was quite satisfied with myself.I am also known for this at the Exchange-I mean for always possessing a sound judgment.This Resident and his wife were agreeable and kind.They told us much of their manner of life in the Indies : it must be very pleasant there.They said that their country-seat near Driebergen was not half so large as what they called their "" grounds, "" in the interior of Java, and that a hundred men were required to keep it in order.But-and this is a proof of how they were liked-all this was done for nothing, and out of pure attachment."	stern
369	369	They told us also, that when they went away the sale of their furniture had produced a large profit, as it fetched ten times its value ; for that the native chiefs were all of them so fond of buying a keepsake of the Resident.  I told this afterwards to Stern, who maintained that this was done by coercion, and that he could prove it out of Shawlman's parcel ; but I told him that this Shawlman was a slanderer,—that he had run away with girls, like that young German at Busselinck andWaterman's,—that I did not attach the least value to his judgment, for that I had now learnt from a Resident himself how matters stood, and had therefore nothing to learn from Shawlman.There were still more persons from the Indies, amongst others a very rich gentleman, who had gained much money on tea, which the Javanese made him for little money, and which the Government bought from him for a high price, to encourage the activity of the Javanese.This gentleman was also very angry with all those discontented persons, who are always speaking and writing against the Government.He could not say enough in praise of the government of the Colonies ; for he said that he had the conviction that it lost a great deal in tea, which it bought from him, and that was therefore very generous in invariably paying such a high price for an article, intrinsically of little value, which he himself did not like, for he always drank Chinese tea.He said also, that the Governor-General, who had prolonged the so-called tea-contracts, notwithstanding the calculation that the nation lost so much on this, such a clever, good man was he, and, above all, a good friend of those who had known him formerly; for that this Governor-General had not paid  the least attention to the talk about losses on the tea,and had done him therefore a great deal of good by not cancelling those tea-contracts.Yes,” he went on, “ my heart bleeds, when I perceive that such noble persons are slandered : if he had not been there, I should have to walk with my wife and children .”Thereupon he ordered his carriage, and it looked so magnificent, and the horses were so beautiful and so fat,that I can understand why he is full of gratitude to such a Governor-General.It does one's heart good to behold such charming emotions, above all when comparing them with that accursed grumbling and complaining of persons like that Shawlman .	stern
370	370	The following day, the Resident and that gentleman for whom the Javanese make tea, returned our visit.Both of them at once asked us by what train we thought of going to Amsterdam .We did not know what this meant,but afterwards it was clear to us, for when we arrived there on Monday morning, there were two servants at the station, one with a red waistcoat, and one with a yellow one, who both at the same time told us that he had received an order by telegram , to fetch us in a carriage.My wife was confused, and I thought what would Busselinck and Waterman have said if they had seen that,--I mean that there were two carriages for us.But it was not easy to make a choice, for I could not resolve to hurt one of the parties by refusing such a nice  offer.Good advice was dear; but I came victorious out of this great difficulty.I put my wife and Mary in the red carriage, the red waistcoat I mean--- and I went in the yellow one,---I mean the carriage.How those horses tore along! on the Weesper Street where it is always so dirty, the mud flew as high as the houses, and there I saw the miserable Shawlman, his back bent, his head bowed down--and I saw how he tried to wipe the mud off his pale face with the sleeve of his threadbare coat.   Chapter XIX  In the private letter which Mr. Slymering sent to Havelaar, he communicated to him, that he, notwithstanding his pressing business, would come the next day to Rankas-Betong, to deliberate on what ought to be done.	stern
371	371	"Havelaar, who knew what such a deliberation meant- his predecessor had so often deliberated with the Resident of Bantam - wrote the following letter,which he sent to meet the Resident, and be read by him before his arrival at Lebak :  “ 25th Feb. 1856, 11 P.M. “ Yesterday at 12 o'clock, I had the honour to send you my missive (Immediate, No. 88) containing in substance “ That I, after a long investigation, and after having tried in vain to bring back by moderation the party concerned from his perversity, felt myself obliged by my official oath to accuse the Regent of Lebak of abuse of power, and to add that I suspected him of extortion.I have taken the liberty to propose to you in that letter, to summon that native chief to Serang, in order to examine after his departure, and after the corrupting influence of his extensive family had been neutralized, whether my accusation and suspicion were well founded. ""Long, or to speak more accurately, much have I reflected "" before determining upon this."" I took care to let you know that I have endeavoured, "" by exhortation and threats, to save the old Regent from "" misfortune and shame, and myself from the deep regret "" of having been the immediate cause of his troubles. ""But on the other hand, I saw the (for many years) "" plundered and much oppressed population.I thought of "" the necessity of an example—for I shall have to report "" to you many more vexations,—if, at least this affair, by "" its reaction makes no end of them,—and, I repeat it, "" after mature consideration, I did what I thought to be "" my duty."" I have just received your kind and esteemed private "" letter communicating that you will come here to-morrow, "" and at the same time a hint that I ought to have treated "" this affair privately at first.To-morrow I shall therefore "" have the honour to see you, and it is exactly on that "" account that I have taken the liberty to send you this  "" letter, to add, before our meeting, the following considerations :— "" All my investigations about the Regent were quite "" secret ; only he and the Patteh (Adjutant of the Regent) "" knew it, for I myself had frankly warned him.Even the "" Controller knows only a part of my investigations.This "" secrecy had a double aim."	stern
372	372	"At first when I still hoped to "" bring back the Regent to the right way, it was my object "" if I succeeded not to compromise him.The Patteh "" thanked me in the name of the Regent for this discretion.(It was on the 12th inst.)But afterwards when I began to despair of the success of my endeavours,—or rather, when the measure of my indignation overflowed on hearing of a recent occurrence ; —when a longer silence would have become participation as an accomplice—then that secrecy would have been to my advantage ; for I too have to fulfil duties towards my household and myself.For after writing my letter of yesterday, I should be unworthy to serve the Government, if what I wrote down then was vain, unfounded, or invented.And would or will it be possible to me to prove that I have done what a good Assistant Resident ought to do—to prove that I am "" not unworthy the functions which I have received ;— to "" prove that I do not risk thoughtlessly and rashly my seventeen "" hard years in the service of the Government, and, "" what is of more importance still, the interest of wife and "" child—will it be possible for me to prove all this, unless  "" deep secrecy does not hide my investigations, and prevent the "" criminal from concealing himself ?"" At the least suspicion the Regent would send an express to his "" nephew, who is coming here, and whose "" interest it is to maintain him, at any sacrifice, and to  "" distribute money with a profuse hand to every one "" whom he had recently swindled, the consequence "" would be (I need not say will be) that I have passed a "" rash judgment, and am an unserviceable functionary, "" not to say worse. ""To prevent that result I write this letter.I have the "" highest esteem for you ; but I know the spirit of East "" Indian functionaries, and I do not possess that spirit."" Your hint that it would have been better to have "" treated the affair privately at first, makes me apprehensive "" of such a course."	stern
373	373	"What I said in my missive of "" yesterday is true ; but perhaps it would seem untrue if "" the affair was treated in such a manner as would reveal "" my accusation and suspicion before the removal of the "" Regent.I may not conceal from you that even your "" unexpected arrival in connexion with the express sent "" by me yesterday to Serang, gives me reason to fear that "" the accused, who would not listen to my exhortations, "" will now awake too soon, and endeavour, if possible, tant "" soit peu to exculpate himself."" I have the honour to say that I still refer literally to "" my missive of yesterday ; but I take the liberty to  "" observe that this missive contained a proposal to remove "" the Regent before the investigation, and previously to "" make his adherents harmless ; and at the same time that "" I believe myself to be no further responsible for what I "" advanced,than so far as you may be pleased to agree to "" my proposition as regards the manner of investigation— "" that it should be impartial, open, and above all, free. ""This liberty cannot exist before the removal of the "" Regent ; and according to my humble opinion, there is "" nothing dangerous in that ; as he can be told that I "" accuse him and suspect him, that I am in danger, and "" not he, in the event of his innocence being established:— "" for I myself am of opinion that I ought to be dismissed, if "" it shall appear that I have acted precipitately or rashly. ""Precipitately ! . . .After years and years of abuses ! ""as if an honest man could sleep, and live, "" and enjoy, while they, over whose welfare he is called "" upon to watch, who are in the highest sense his neighbours, "" suffer extortion and injustice !"" I have been here, it is true, but a short time.I hope, "" however, that the question will for once be, what has "" been done, if anything has been well done, and not "" whether it has been done in too short a time.For me, "" every moment is too long, when characterized by extortion "" and oppression, and every second weighs heavy on "" me that is passed in misery by my negligence, by my "" ' spirit of arranging.'"	stern
374	374	""" I regret the days which I allowed to pass away before "" reporting to you officially, and I apologize for that "" neglect."" I have taken the liberty to request you to give me the "" opportunity to justify my letter of yesterday, and to "" guarantee me against the miscarriage of my endeavours "" to free the province of Lebak from the worms which "" have gnawed, since the memory of man, at its welfare."" It is therefore that I have again taken the liberty of "" asking you to approve my action, which consists only of "" investigating, reporting, and proposing to remove the Regent "" of Lebak, without direct or indirect notice beforehand ; and "" moreover to order an investigation to take "" place of what I communicated in my letter of yesterday, "" No.88.—The Assistant Resident of Lebak, (Signed) "" Max Havelaar.This request, not to take the criminals under his protection, the Resident received on the way.An hour after his arrival at Rankas-Betong, he paid a visit to the Regent, and asked him whether he could "" say anything to the prejudice of the Assistant Resident,"" and whether he, the Regent, "" wanted money.""To the first question the Regent replied, "" I have nothing against him !I can solemnly swear to that ! ""The second question he answered in the affirmative, whereupon the Resident gave him a couple of bank-notes.It may be understood that Havelaar knew nothing of this."	stern
375	375	"We shall see by and by how he became acquainted with so shameful a transaction.When the Resident Slymering entered Havelaar's house, he was paler than usual, and the intervals between his words were longer than ever.It was indeed no small thing for a person who so excelled in arranging and making out the yearly reports of "" tranquillity,"" to receive so unexpectedly letters in which there was no trace either of optimism or of artificial colouring, or of fear of the disapprobation of the Government.The Resident of Bantam was in a fright ; and if I may be forgiven the ignoble comparison for the sake of exactness, I feel inclined to liken him to a little street-boy who complains of the violation of old customs, because he has been beaten without previous abusive language.He began by asking the Controller why the latter had not endeavoured to restrain Havelaar from his accusation ?Poor Verbrugge, who was entirely unacquainted with the circumstances, said so, but was not believed.Mr. Slymering could not believe that any person without assistance could do his duty in such a manner.As Verbrugge, however, maintained his ignorance, the Resident began to read Havelaar's letters.What Verbrugge suffered in listening is indescribable.He was an honest man, and would not have lied if Havelaar had appealed to him to confirm the truth of the contents of these letters."	stern
376	376	"But even without that honesty, he had not always been able to avoid the truth in many written reports, even where it was dangerous to tell it.How would it be if Havelaar made use of those reports?After having read these letters, the Resident said that, if Havelaar chose to recall these documents, it would be agreeable to him to consider them as not written, which Havelaar firmly but politely refused.Having in vain tried to move him to this, the Resident said that he must investigate the charges, and that he had therefore to request Havelaar to summon the witnesses in support of the accusation he had brought against the Regent.Ye poor creatures, whose sides had been wounded by the thorns in the ravine, how anxiously would your hearts have beaten if you could have heard this request !And you, poor Verbrugge, you first witness, chief witness, ex officio witness, a witness in virtue of office and oath, a witness who had already borne witness on paper, which lay there on the table under Havelaar's hand ! . . . .Havelaar replied :— "" Mr. Resident,—I am Assistant Resident of Lebak ; I have promised to protect the population from extortion and tyranny ; I accuse the Regent and his son-in-law of Parang-Koodjang ; I will prove my accusation as soon as that opportunity is given me, which I proposed in  my letters.I am guilty of slander if this accusation is false!""How freely Verbrugge breathed again !And how strange the Resident thought Havelaar's words."	stern
377	377	"The conversation lasted long.With politeness,— for Slymering was polite and well-bred,—he urged Havelaar to turn aside from such wrong principles ; but with as much politeness the latter remained immoveable.The result was, that the Resident had to yield, in saying as a threat, what was to Havelaar a victory, that he should be compelled to bring the matter under the notice of the Government.The meeting was ended.The Resident paid the visit to the Regent, to put to him the questions already mentioned, and then dined at the scanty board of the Havelaars, after which he returned in great haste to Serang, "" because---he---had---still--- so---much---to---do."" The next day Havelaar received a letter from the Resident of Bantam, the contents of which may be understood from the reply, of which I here give a copy :—  "" No. 93.—Private. ""RANKAS-BETONG, 28th February 1856."" I have had the honour to receive your missive of the "" 26th inst.(La. O, private), containing mainly the following :—  "" That you had reasons for not accepting the proposals "" made in both my official letters of the 24th and 25th '' inst.,Nos. 88 and 91 ; "" That you had desired a previous confidential communication ; "" That you do not approve of my transactions described "" in both those letters ; "" And lastly, some orders."	stern
378	378	""" I have now the honour again to assert, as I did verbally in the meeting of the day before yesterday :— "" That I fully respect the legality of your power as regards deciding whether to accept my proposition or "" not :— "" That the orders received shall with exactness be "" obeyed— with self-sacrifice, if need be, as if you were "" present to witness all I do or say, or, more properly, all "" I do not do or do not say."" I know that you place confidence in my good faith in "" this matter. ""But I take the liberty solemnly to protest against the "" least semblance of disapprobation of any action, any "" word, any phrase, done, spoken, or written by me in this "" matter.I am convinced that I have done my duty :— "" in my object and in the manner of executing it quite my "" duty ;—nothing but my duty, without the least deviation."" I have long pondered before acting (that is : before "" examining, reporting, and proposing), and if I have been  "" to a certain extent mistaken in anything,—my fault was "" not precipitancy.In the same circumstances I should do again-yet a little quicker -exactly, exactly the same.""
