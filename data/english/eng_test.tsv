838	838	" ""God be praised,"" said Tine, ""that you can be your own self at last."	droogstoppel
839	839	Havelaar received no instructions to surrender the Government to Verbrugge ; he therefore awaited his successor.	droogstoppel

875	875	Then Havelaar departed with wife and child from Rankas-Betong.	droogstoppel
876	876	He refused all escort.	droogstoppel
877	877	Duclari and Verbrugge were deeply touched at the leave-taking.	droogstoppel
878	878	Max was likewise moved ; above all, when he found at the first stage a great number of persons who had gone secretly from Rankas-Betong to bid him a last farewell.	droogstoppel
879	879	At Serang,the family was received into the house of Mr. Slymering, with the ordinary Indian hospitality.	droogstoppel
880	880	In the evening many visitors came to the Resident.	droogstoppel
881	881	They said they had come to say farewell to Havelaar, and Havelaar received many an eloquent shake of the hand ...   	droogstoppel
882	882	But he had to go to Batavia to speak to the Governor-General.	droogstoppel
883	883	When they arrived there, he sought for an audience.	droogstoppel
884	884	This was refused him, because his Excellency had a pain in his foot.	droogstoppel
885	885	Havelaar waited till the foot was cured.	droogstoppel
886	886	Then he again sought an audience.	droogstoppel
887	887	"His Excellency "" had so much to do that he had been obliged to refuse an audience even to the Director-General of Finance, and could not see Havelaar."""	droogstoppel
888	888	Havelaar waited till his Excellency should have struggled through all this ; meanwhile he felt something like jealousy for the persons who had to help his Excellency in his labour, for he liked to work quickly and hard, and generally so much business disappeared under his hand.	droogstoppel
889	889	This was, however, out of the question.	droogstoppel
890	890	Havelaar's labour was heavier than labour. ...	droogstoppel
891	891	At last he again sought an audience.	droogstoppel
892	892	He received an answer that his Excellency could not see him, as he had too much to do, being on the point of departure.	droogstoppel
893	893	"Max sought the favour of his Excellency to be heard for half-an-hour as soon as there should be some space between two "" businesses."""	droogstoppel
894	894	At last he heard that his Excellency would depart the next day !	droogstoppel
895	895	That was a thunderbolt for him.	droogstoppel
896	896	Still he believed with spasmodic energy that the resigning Governor was an honest man, and had been deceived.	droogstoppel
897	897	A quarter of an hour would have sufficed to prove the justice of his cause, and it appeared that this quarter of an hour would not be granted him.	droogstoppel
898	898	I find among Havelaar's papers the copy of a letter which he seems to have written to the retiring Governor-General, on the last evening before his departure to the mother country.	droogstoppel
899	899	"In the corner I find the words written in pencil "" not exact"" which gives me to understand that some phrases were changed in copying."	droogstoppel
900	900	I make this observation in order that no doubt may arise regarding the authenticity of the other official documents which I have communicated, and which have all been signed by another hand for exact copy ; I mention this, because of the want of literal conformity with this document.	droogstoppel
901	901	Perhaps he to whom this letter was addressed may feel inclined to make public the exact text ; then one may see how far Havelaar deviated from this copy.	droogstoppel

922	922	Another Excellency had retired to the mother country to rest !	droogstoppel
3222	3222	Some days afterwards Saïdjah's father fled out of the country ; for he was much afraid of being punished for not paying his land- taxes, and he had not another heirloom to sell, that he might buy a new buffalo, because his parents had always lived in Parang -Koodjang, and had therefore left him but few things.	stern
3223	3223	The parents of his wife too lived in the same district.	stern
3224	3224	However, he went on for some years after the loss of his last buffalo, by working with hired animals for ploughing ; but that is a very ungrateful labour, and moreover, sad for a person who has had buffaloes of his own.	stern
3225	3225	Saïdjah's mother died of grief, and then it was that his father, in a moment of dejection, fled from Bantam , in order to endeavour to get labour in the Buitenzorg districts.	stern
3226	3226	But he was punished with stripes , because he had left Lebak without a passport, and was brought back by the police to Badoer.	stern
3227	3227	There he was put in prison, because  he was supposed to be mad, which I can readily believe, and because it was feared that he would run amuck in a moment of mata-glap.	stern

3229	3229	What became of the brothers and sisters of Saidjah I do not know.	stern

3233	3233	Saidjah was already fifteen years of age, when his father set out for Buitenzorg ; and he did not accompany him thither, because he had other plans in view.	stern
3234	3234	He had been told that there were at Batavia many gentlemen, who drove in bendies, and that it would be easy for him to get a post as bendieboy, for which generally a young person is chosen, so as not to disturb the equilibrium of the two-wheeled carriage by too much weight behind.	stern
3235	3235	He would, they told him, gain much in that way if he behaved well,—perhaps he would be able to spare in three years money enough to buy two buffaloes.	stern
3236	3236	This was a smiling prospect for him.	stern
3237	3237	With the proud step of one who has conceived a grand idea, he,  after his father's flight, entered Adinda's house , and communicated to her his plan.	stern
3238	3238	“ Think of it,” said he, “ when I come back we shall be old enough to marry, and shall possess two buffaloes ! ”	stern
3239	3239	Very well, Saïdjah, I will gladly marry you when you return .	stern
3240	3240	I will spin and weave sarongs and slendangs, and be very diligent all the time.”	stern
3241	3241	“ Oh, I believe you , Adinda, but ... if I find you married ? '	stern
3242	3242	“ Saïdjah, you know very well that I shall marry no-body but you ; my father promised me to your father .”	stern
3243	3243	"""And you yourself ?”"	stern
3244	3244	“ I shall marry you, you may be sure of that.”	stern
3245	3245	“ When I come back , I will call from afar off.”	stern
3246	3246	"""Who shall hear it, if we are stamping rice in the village ? ""  "	stern
3247	3247	"""That is true, ... but , Adinda, ..."	stern
3248	3248	"oh yes, this is better, wait for me under the djati wood, under the ketapan where you gave me the melatti."""	stern
3249	3249	"“ But, Saïdjah, how can I know when I am to go to the ketapan ? ”  Saidjah considered and said : — "" Count the moons ; I shall stay away three times twelve moons, . . ."	stern
3250	3250	this moon not included. . . .	stern
3251	3251	See, Adinda, at every new moon, cut a notch in your rice-block.	stern
3252	3252	"When you have cut three times twelve lines, I will be under the Ketapan the next day, ... do you promise to be there?"""	stern
3253	3253	""" Yes, Saidjah, I will be there under the ketapan, near the djati-wood, when you come back."	stern
3254	3254	Hereupon Saidjah tore a piece off his blue turban, which was very much worn, and gave the piece of linen to Adinda to keep it as a pledge ; and then he left her and Badoer.	stern
3255	3255	He walked many days.	stern
3256	3256	He passed Rankas-Betong, which was not then the capital of Lebak, and Warong-Goonoong, where was the house of the Assistant Resident, and the following day saw Pamarangang, which lies as in a garden.	stern
3257	3257	The next day he arrived at Serang, and was astonished at the magnificence and size of the place, and the number of stone houses covered with red tiles.	stern
3258	3258	Saidjah had never before seen such a thing.	stern
3259	3259	He remained there a day, because he was tired ; but, during the night, in the coolness, he went further, and the following day, before the shadow had descended to his lips, though he wore the large toodoong which his father had left him, he arrived at Tangerang.	stern
3260	3260	At Tangerang he bathed in the river near the passage, and rested in the house of an acquaintance of his father's,  who showed him how to make straw-hats like those that come from Manilla.	stern
3261	3261	He stayed there a day to learn that, because he thought to be able to get something by that afterwards, if he should perhaps not succeed at Batavia.	stern
3262	3262	The following day towards the evening when it was cool he thanked his host very much, and went on.	stern
3263	3263	As soon as it was quite dark, when nobody could see it, he brought forth the leaf in which he kept the ' melatti ' which Adinda had given him under the ' Ketapan ' tree, for he was sad because he should not see her for so long a time.	stern
3264	3264	The first day, and the second day likewise, he had not felt so much how lonely he was, because his soul was quite captivated by the grand idea of gaining money enough to buy two buffaloes, and his father had never possessed more than one ; and his thoughts were too much concentrated in the hope of seeing Adinda again, to make room for much grief at his leave-taking.	stern
3265	3265	He took that leave in anxious hope, and mingled the memory of it in his thoughts, with the prospect of again seeing Adinda at last under the ketapan.	stern
3266	3266	For this prospect so occupied his heart that he, on leaving Badoer, and passing that tree, felt something like joy, as if the thirty-six moons were already past that separated him from that moment.	stern
3267	3267	It had appeared to him as if he had only to turn round, as if on his return from the journey, to see Adinda waiting for him under the tree.	stern
3268	3268	But the further he went away from Badoer, the more attention he paid to the duration of one  day, the longer he thought the period of the thirty-six moons before him.	stern
3269	3269	There was something in his soul which made him walk less quickly— he felt affliction in his knees, and though it was not dejection that overcame him, yet it was mournfulness, which is not far from it.	stern
3270	3270	He thought of returning ;—but what would Adinda think of so little heart ?	stern
3271	3271	Therefore he walked on, though less rapidly than the first day.	stern
3272	3272	He had the ' melatti ' in his hand, and often pressed it to his breast.	stern
3273	3273	He had become much older during the last three days, and he no longer understood how he had lived so calmly before, when Adinda was so near him, and he could see her as often as he liked.	stern
3274	3274	But now he could not be calm, when he expected that he should see her again by and by.	stern
3275	3275	Nor did he understand why he after having taken leave had not returned once more to look at her again.	stern
3276	3276	And he even remembered how a short time ago he had quarrelled with her about the cord which she had made for the lalayang of her brother, and which had broken because there was a defect in her work by which a wager had been lost against the children of Tjipoeroet.	stern
3277	3277	""" How was it possible,"" he thought, "" to have been angry about that with Adinda ?"	stern
3278	3278	For if there was a defect in the cord, and if the wager of Badoer against  Tjipoeroet had been lost in consequence, and not by the piece of glass which little Djamien had thrown while hiding himself behind the pagger, ought I then to have been so rough to her, and called her by unseemly names ?	stern
3279	3279	What if I die at Batavia without having asked her pardon for such harshness ?	stern
3280	3280	Will it not make me appear as if I were a bad man, who scolds a girl ?	stern
3281	3281	"And when it is heard that I have died in a foreign country, will not every one at Badoer say, ' It is good that Saidjah died ; for he had an insolent mouth against Adinda ? """	stern
3282	3282	Thus his thoughts took a course which differed much from their former buoyancy, and involuntarily were uttered, first in half words and softly, soon in a monologue, and at last in the melancholy song, of which a translation follows.	stern
3283	3283	My first intention was to have recourse to measure and rhyme in this translation ; but, like Havelaar, I thought it better to leave it without the corset.	stern
3284	3284	""" I do not know where I shall die."	stern
3285	3285	I saw the great sea on the south-coast, when I was there with my father making salt ; If I die at sea, and my body is thrown into the deep water, then sharks will come : They will swim round my corpse, and ask, ' Which of us shall devour the body, that goes down into the water?'	stern
3286	3286	I shall not hear it !	stern
3287	3287	""" I do not know where I shall die."	stern
3288	3288	I saw in a blaze the house of Pa-ansoe, which he himself has set on fire because he was mala-glap ; If I die in a burning house, glowing embers will fall on my corpse ; And outside the house there will be many cries of men throwing water on the fire to kill it ;— I shall not hear it !	stern
3289	3289	""" I do not know where I shall die."	stern
3290	3290	I saw the little Si-Oenah fall out of a klappa-tree, when he plucked a klappa1 for his mother ; If I fall out of a klappa-tree I shall lie dead below, in the shrubs, like Si-Oenah.	stern
3291	3291	Then my mother will not weep, for she is dead.	stern
3292	3292	But others will say with a loud voice : ' See, there lies Saidjah.'	stern
3293	3293	I shall not hear it !	stern
3294	3294	""" I do not know where I shall die."	stern
3295	3295	I have seen the corpse of Pa-lisoe, who died of old age ; for his hairs were white : If I die of old age, with white hairs, hired women will stand weeping near my corpse ; And they will make lamentation, as did the mourners over Pa-lisoe's corpse ; and the grandchildren will weep, very loud ; I shall not hear it !	stern
3296	3296	"""I do not know where I shall die."	stern
3297	3297	I have seen at Badoer many that were dead.	stern
3298	3298	They were dressed in white shrouds, and were buried in the earth ; If I die at Badoer, and I am buried beyond the dessah, eastward against the hill, where the grass is high ; Then will Adinda pass by there, and the border of her sarong will sweep softly along the grass, . . .	stern
3299	3299	"I shall hear it.""  Saidjah arrived at Batavia."	stern
3300	3300	He begged a gentleman to take him into his service, which this gentleman did,  because he did not understand Saidjah's language; for they like to have servants at Batavia who do not speak Malay, and are, therefore, not so corrupted as others, who have been longer in connexion with Europeans.	stern
3301	3301	Saidjah soon learned Malay, but behaved well ; for he always thought of the two buffaloes which he should buy, and of Adinda.	stern
3302	3302	He became tall and strong, because he ate every day, what could not always be had at Badoer.	stern
3303	3303	He was liked in the stable, and would certainly not have been rejected, if he had asked the hand of the coachman's daughter.	stern
3304	3304	His master even liked Saidjah so much that he soon promoted him to be an indoor servant, increased his wages, and continually made him presents, to show that he was well pleased with his services.	stern
3305	3305	Saidjah's mistress had read Sue's novel, which for a short time was so popular : she always thought of Prince Djalma when she saw Saidjah, and the young girls, too, understood better than before how the Javanese painter, Radeen Saleh, had met with such great success at Paris.	stern
3306	3306	But they thought Saidjah ungrateful, when he, after almost three years of service, asked for his dismissal, and a certificate that he had always behaved well.	stern
3307	3307	This could not be refused, and Saidjah went on his journey with a joyful heart.	stern
3308	3308	He passed Pisang, where Havelaar once lived many years ago.	stern
3309	3309	But Saidjah did not know this, . . .	stern
3310	3310	and even  if he had known it, he had something else in his soul which occupied him. ...	stern
3311	3311	He counted the treasures which he was carrying home.	stern
3312	3312	In a roll of bamboo he had his passport and a certificate of good conduct.	stern
3313	3313	In a case, which was fastened to a leathern girdle, something heavy seemed to sling continually against his shoulder, but he liked to feel that. . . .	stern
3314	3314	And no wonder ! . . .	stern
3315	3315	this contained thirty piastres, enough to buy three buffaloes !	stern
3316	3316	What would Adinda say ?	stern
3317	3317	And this was not all.	stern
3318	3318	On his back could be seen the silver-covered sheath of the kris, which he wore in the girdle.	stern
3319	3319	The hilt was certainly very fine, for he had wound it round with a silk wrapper.	stern
3320	3320	And he had still more treasures !	stern
3321	3321	In the folds of the kahin round his loins, he kept a belt of silver links, with gold ikat-pendieng.	stern
3322	3322	It is true that the belt was short, but she was so slender. . . .	stern
3323	3323	And suspended by a cord round his neck, under his baadjoe, he wore a small silk bag, in which were some withered leaves of the ' melatti.'	stern
3324	3324	Was it a wonder that he stopped no longer at Sangerang than was necessary to visit the acquaintances of his father who made such fine straw hats ?	stern
3325	3325	Was it a wonder  that he said little to the girls on his road, who asked him where he came from, and where he was going—the common saluation in those regions ?	stern
3326	3326	Was it a wonder that he no longer thought Serang so beautiful, he who had learnt to know Batavia ?	stern
3327	3327	That he hid himself no more behind the ' pagger ' as he did three years ago, when he saw the Resident riding out ; for he had seen the much grander lord, who lives at Buitenzorg, and who is the grandfather of the Soosoohoonan (Emperor) of Solo ?	stern
3328	3328	Was it a wonder that he did not pay much attention to the tales of those who went a part of the way with him, and spoke of the news in Bantam-Kidool ; how the coffee culture had been quite suspended after much unrewarded labour ; how the district chief of Parang-Koodjang had been condemned to fourteen days' arrest at the house of his father-in-law for highway robbery ; how the capital had been removed to Rankas-Betong ; how a new Assistant Resident was there, because the other had died some months ago ; how this new functionary had spoken at the first Sebah meeting ; how for some time nobody had been punished for complaining; how the people hoped that all that had been stolen would be returned or paid for?	stern
3329	3329	No, he had sublime visions before his mind's eye.	stern
3330	3330	He sought for the ' Ketapan' tree in the clouds, as he was still too far off to seek it at Badoer.	stern
3331	3331	He caught at the air  which surrounded him, as if he would embrace the form which was to meet him under that tree.	stern
3332	3332	He pictured to himself the face of Adinda, her head, her shoulders ; he saw the heavy kondeh (chignon), so black and glossy, confined in a net, hanging down her neck ; he saw her large eye glistening in dark reflection ; the nostrils which she raised so proudly as a child, when he---how was it possible ?	stern
3333	3333	---vexed her, and the corner of her lips, where she preserved a smile ; he saw her breast, which would now swell under the kabaai ; he saw how well the sarong of her own making fitted her hips, and descending along the thighs in a curve, fell in graceful folds on the small foot.	stern
3334	3334	No ; he heard little of what was told him.	stern
3335	3335	"He heard quite different tones ; he heard how Adinda would say "" Welcome, Saidjah !"	stern
3336	3336	I have thought of you in spinning and weaving, and stampiug the rice on the floor, which bears three times twelve lines made by my hand.	stern
3337	3337	Here I am under the ' Ketapan ' the first day of the new moon.	stern
3338	3338	Welcome, Saidjah, I will be your wife.	stern
3339	3339	""" That was the music which resounded in his ears, and prevented him from listening to all the news that was told him on the road."	stern
3340	3340	At last he saw the ' Ketapan,' or rather he saw a large dark spot, which many stars covered, before his eye.	stern
3341	3341	That must be the wood of Djati, near the tree where he should see again Adinda, next morning after sunrise.	stern
3342	3342	He  sought in the dark, and felt many trunks-soon found the well-known roughness on the south side of a tree, and thrust his finger into a hole which Si-Panteh had cut with his parang to exorcise the pontianak who was the cause of his mother's toothache, a short time before the birth of Panteh's little brother.	stern
3343	3343	That was the Ketapan he looked for.	stern
3344	3344	Yes, this was indeed the spot where he had looked upon Adinda for the first time with quite a different eye from his other companions in play, because she had for the first time refused to take part in a game which she had played with other children-boys and girls-only a short time before.	stern
3345	3345	There she had given him the ' melatti.'	stern
3346	3346	He sat down at the foot of the tree, and looked at the stars; and when he saw a shooting-star he accepted it as a welcome of his return to Badoer, and he thought whether Adinda would now be asleep, and whether she had rightly cut the moons on her rice floor.	stern
3347	3347	It would be such a grief to him if she had omitted a moon, as if thirty-six were not enough ! . . .	stern
3348	3348	And he wondered whether she had made nice ' sarongs ' and 'slendangs ?'	stern
3349	3349	And he asked himself, too, who would now be dwelling in her father's house ?	stern
3350	3350	And he thought of his youth, and of his mother; and how that buffalo had saved him from the tiger, and he thought of what would have become of Adinda if that buffalo had  been less faithful !	stern
3351	3351	He paid much attention to the sinking of the stars in the west, and as each star disappeared in the horizon, he calculated how much nearer the sun was to his rising in the east, and how much nearer he himself was to seeing Adinda.	stern
3352	3352	For she would certainly come at the first beam---yes, at daybreak she would be there, . . .	stern
3353	3353	Why had not she already come the day before ?	stern
3354	3354	It pained him, that she had not anticipated the supreme moment which had lighted up his soul for three years with inexpressible brightness ; and, unjust as he was in the selfishness of his love, it appeared to him that Adinda ought to have been there waiting for him, who complained before the time appointed, that he had to wait for her.	stern
3355	3355	And he complained unjustly, for neither had the sun risen, nor had the eye of day cast a glance on the plain.	stern
3356	3356	The stars, it is true, were growing pale up there !	stern
3357	3357	ashamed as they were of the approaching end of their rule ; strange colours were flowing over the tops of the mountains, which appeared darker as they contrasted sharply with places more brightly illuminated; here and there flowed something glowing in the east—arrows of gold and of fire that were shot hither and thither, parallel to the horizon ;—but they disappeared again, and seemed to fall down behind the impenetrable curtain, which hid the day from the eyes of Saidjah.	stern
3358	3358	Yet it grew lighter and lighter around him— he now saw the landscape, and could  already distinguish a part of the Klappa-wood behind which Badoer lay :—there Adinda slept.	stern
3359	3359	No! surely she did not sleep ; how could she sleep ? . .	stern
3360	3360	Did she not know that Saidjah would be awaiting her?	stern
3361	3361	She had not slept the whole night certainly ; the night police of the village had knocked at her door to ask, why the pelitat (Javanese lamp) continued burning in her cottage ; and with a sweet laugh she had said, that a vow kept her awake to weave the ' slendang,' in which she was occupied, and which must be ready before the first day of the new moon.	stern
3362	3362	Or she had passed the night in darkness, sitting on the rice floor and counting with her eager finger, that indeed thirty-six deep lines were cut near each other.	stern
3363	3363	And she had amused herself with an imaginary fright as to whether she had miscalculated, perhaps had counted one less, to enjoy again and again, and every time, the delicious assurance, that without fail three times twelve moons had passed since Saidjah saw her for the last time.	stern
3364	3364	And now that it was becoming light, she too would be exerting herself with useless trouble, to bend her looks over the horizon to meet the sun, the lazy sun, that stayed away .... stayed away. . . .	stern
3365	3365	There came a line of bluish-red, which touched the clouds and made the edges light and glowing ;—and it began to lighten, and again arrows of fire shot through the atmosphere; but this time they did not disappear,  they seized upon the dark ground, and communicated their blaze in larger and larger circles, meeting, crossing, unrolling, turning, wandering, and uniting in patches of fire and lightnings of golden lustre on the azure ground . . .	stern
3366	3366	there was red, and blue, and silver, and purple, and yellow, and gold, in all this ...	stern
3367	3367	that was the daybreak, that was seeing Adinda again !	stern
3368	3368	Saidjah had not learnt to pray, and it would have been a pity to teach him ; for a more holy prayer, more fervent thanksgiving than was in the mute rapture of his soul, could not be conceived in human language.	stern
3369	3369	He would not go to Badoer—to see Adinda in reality seeming to him less pleasurable than the expectation of seeing her again.	stern
3370	3370	He sat down at the foot of the ' Ketapan,' and his eyes wandered over the scenery.	stern
3371	3371	Nature smiled at him, and seemed to welcome him as a mother welcoming the return of her child, and as she pictures her joy by voluntary remembrance of past grief, when showing what she has preserved as a keepsake during his absence.	stern
3372	3372	So Saidjah was delighted to see again so many spots that were witnesses of his short life.	stern
3373	3373	But his eyes or his thoughts might wander as they pleased, yet his looks and longings always reverted to the path which leads from Badoer to the Ketapan tree.	stern
3374	3374	All that his senses could observe was called Adinda. ...	stern
3375	3375	He saw the abyss to the left, where the earth is so yellow, where once a young buffalo sank down into the depth,—they had descended with strong  rattan cords, and Adinda's father had been the bravest.	stern
3376	3376	Oh, how she clapped her hands, Adinda!	stern
3377	3377	And there, further on, on the other side, where the wood of cocoa-trees waved over the cottages of the village, there some where, Si-Oenah had fallen out of a tree and died.	stern
3378	3378	"How his mother cried, ""because Si Oenah was still such a little one,"" she lamented, ... as if she would have been less grieved if Si-Oenah had been taller."	stern
3379	3379	But he was small, that is true, for he was smaller and more fragile than Adinda. . . .	stern
3380	3380	Nobody walked upon the little road which leads from Badoer to the tree.	stern
3381	3381	By and by she would come ... it was yet very early.	stern
3382	3382	Saidjah saw a badjing (squirrel) spring with playful nimbleness up the trunk of a cocoa-tree.	stern
3383	3383	The graceful animal—the terror of the proprietor of the tree, but still lovely in form and movement—ran untiringly up and down.	stern
3384	3384	Saidjah saw it, and forced himself to stay and look at it, because this calmed his thoughts after their heavy labour since sunrise—rest after the fatiguing expectancy.	stern
3385	3385	Soon he uttered his impressions in words, and sang what his soul dictated him.	stern
3386	3386	"I would rather read you his lay in Malay, that Italian language of the East :— "" See, how the ' badjing ' looks for his means of living On the Klappa-tree."	stern
3387	3387	He ascends, descends, wantons right and left, He turns (round the tree), springs, falls, climbs, and falls again.	stern
3388	3388	He has no wings, and yet he is as quick as a bird.	stern
3389	3389	Much happiness, my 'badjing,'—I give you hail !	stern
3390	3390	You will surely find the means of living which you seek ;	stern
3391	3391	But I am sittiug alone near the wood of Djati-trees  	stern
3392	3392	Waiting for the food of my heart.	stern
3393	3393	Long has the small appetite of my badjing been sated ; Long has he returned to his little nest ;	stern
3394	3394	But still my soul And my heart are very sad . . .	stern
3395	3395	 Still there was nobody on the path leading from Badoer to the Kelapan. . . .	stern
3396	3396	"Saidjah caught sight of a butterfly which seemed to enjoy itself in the increasing warmth .... """	stern
3397	3397	See how the butterfly flutters everywhere : His wings glisten like a flower of many colours ; His heart is in love with the blossoms of the kenari, Certainly he looks for his fragrant sweetheart.	stern
3398	3398	Much joy, my butterfly, — I give you hail !	stern
3399	3399	You will surely find what you seek ; But I am sitting alone near the Djati-wood, Waiting for what my heart loves : Long since has the butterfly kissed The kenari blossom which it loves so well ; But still my soul	stern
3400	3400	"And my heart are very sad .... Adinda ! """	stern
3401	3401	And still there was no one on the path leading from Badoer to the Ketapan.	stern
3402	3402	The sun began to rise high,—there was warmth in the air.	stern
3403	3403	""" See how the sun glitters on high, High above the waringi—hill !"	stern
3404	3404	He feels too warm and wishes to descend, To sleep in the sea as in the arms of a spouse.	stern
3405	3405	  Much joy, O sun, —I give you hail !	stern
3406	3406	What you seek you will surely find ;	stern
3407	3407	But I sit alone by the Djati-wood Waiting for rest for my heart.	stern
3408	3408	Long the sun will have set And will sleep in the sea, when all is dark ; And still my soul	stern
3409	3409	And my heart will be very sad . . .	stern
3410	3410	And there was nobody on the road leading from Badoer to the Ketapan.	stern

3412	3412	"There was nobody on the path leading from Badoer to the Ketapan. """	stern
3413	3413	Then my corpse will be seen by the angel, He will point it out with his finger to his brethren— ' See, a dead man has been forgotten, His rigid mouth kisses a melatti flower : Come, let us take him up to heaven, Him who has waited for Adinda, till he died, Surely, he may not stay behind alone, Whose heart had the strength to love so much,' Then my rigid mouth shall open once more.	stern
3414	3414	To call Adinda whom my heart loves, I will kiss the melatti once more.	stern
3415	3415	Which she gave me ....	stern
3416	3416	And still there was nobody on the path leading from Badoer to the Ketapan.	stern
3417	3417	she must have fallen asleep towards morning, tired of watching during the night, of watching for manynights :—she had not slept for weeks : so it was !	stern
3418	3418	Should he rise and go to Badoer !	stern
3419	3419	—No, that would be doubting her arrival.	stern
3420	3420	Should he call that man who was driving his buffalo to the field ? . . . .	stern
3421	3421	That man was too far off, and moreover, Saidjah would speak to no one about Adinda, would ask no one after Adinda ....	stern
3422	3422	He would see her again, he would see her alone, he would see her first.	stern
3423	3423	Oh, surely, surely she would soon come !	stern
3424	3424	He would wait, wait ....	stern
3425	3425	But if she were ill, or ... .	stern
3426	3426	Like a wounded stag Saidjah flew along the path leading from the ' Ketapan' to the village where Adinda lived.	stern
3427	3427	"He saw nothing and heard nothing; and yet he could have heard something, for there were men standing in the road at the entrance of the village, who cried— "" Saidjah, Saidjah !"""	stern
3428	3428	But, .... was it his hurry, his eagerness, that prevented him from finding Adinda's house ?	stern
3429	3429	He had already rushed to the end of the road, through the village, and like one mad, he returned and beat his head, because he must have passed her house without seeing it.	stern
3430	3430	But again he was at the entrance of the village, and, ....	stern
3431	3431	Oh God, was it a dream ? . . .	stern
3432	3432	Again he had not found the house of Adinda.	stern
3433	3433	"Again he flew back and suddenly stood still, seized his head with both his hands to press away the madness that overcame him, and cried aloud— "" Drunk, drunk ; I am drunk !"""	stern
3434	3434	And the women of Badoer came out of their houses, and saw with sorrow poor Saidjah standing there, for they knew him, and understood that he was looking for the house of Adinda, and they knew that there was no house of Adinda in the village of Badoer.	stern
3435	3435	For, when the district chief of Parang-Koodjang had taken away Adinda's father's buffaloes. . . .	stern
3436	3436	I told you, reader !	stern
3437	3437	that my narrative was monotonous.	stern
3438	3438	Adinda's mother died of grief, and her baby sister died because she had no mother, and had no one to suckle her.	stern
3439	3439	And Adinda's father, who feared to be punished for not paying his land-taxes. .	stern
3440	3440	I know, I know that my tale is monotonous.	stern
3441	3441	.... had fled out of the country ; he had taken Adinda and her brothers with him.	stern
3442	3442	But he had heard how the father of Saidjah had been punished at Buitenzorg with stripes for leaving Badoer without a passport.	stern
3443	3443	And, therefore, Adinda's father had not gone to Buitenzorg, nor to the Preangan, nor to Bantam.	stern
3444	3444	He had gone to Tjilangkahan, the quarter of Lebak bordering on the sea.	stern
3445	3445	There he had concealed himself in the woods, and waited for the arrival of Pa Ento, Pa Lontah, Si Oeniah, Pa Ansive,  Abdoel Isma, and some others that had been robbed of their buffaloes by the district chief of Parang-Koodjang, and all of whom feared punishment for not paying their land-taxes.	stern
3446	3446	There they had at night taken possession of a fishing-boat, and had gone to sea.	stern
3447	3447	They had steered towards the west, and kept the country to the right of them as far as Java Head : then they had steered northwards till they came in sight of Prince's Island, and sailed round the east coast of that island, and from there to the Lampoons.	stern
3448	3448	Such at least was the way that people told each other in whispers in Lebak, when there was a question of buffalo robbery and unpaid land-taxes.	stern
3449	3449	But Saidjah did not well understand what they said to him ; he did not even quite understand the news of his father's death.	stern
3450	3450	There was a buzzing in his ears, as if a gong had been sounded in his head : he felt the blood throbbing convulsively through the veins of his temples, that threatened to yield under the pressure of such severe distension.	stern
3451	3451	He spoke not : and looked about as one stu pefied, without seeing what was round and about him; and at last he began to laugh horribly.	stern
3452	3452	An old woman led him to her cottage, and took care of the poor fool.	stern
3453	3453	Soon he laughed less horribly, but still did not speak.	stern
3454	3454	"But during the night the inhabitants of the hut were  frightened at his voice, when he sang monotonously : "" I do not know where I shall die,"" and some inhabitants of Badoer put money together, to bring a sacrifice to the bojajas of the Tji-Udjung for the cure of Saidjah, whom they thought insane."	stern
3455	3455	But he was not insane.	stern
3456	3456	For upon a certain night when the moon was very clear, he rose from the baleh-baleh, softly left the house, and sought the place where Adinda had lived.	stern
3457	3457	This was not easy, because so many houses had fallen down; but he seemed to recognise the place by the width of the angle which some rays of light formed through the trees, at their meeting in his eye, as the sailor measures by lighthouses and the tops of mountains.	stern
3458	3458	Yes, there it ought to be :—there Adinda had lived !	stern
3459	3459	Stumbling over half-rotten bamboo and pieces of the fallen roof, he made his way to the sanctuary which he sought.	stern
3460	3460	And, indeed, he found something of the still standing pagger, near to which the baleh-baleh of Adinda had stood, and even the pin of bamboo was still with its point in that pagger, the pin on which she hung her dress when she went to bed.....	stern
3461	3461	But the baleh-baleh had fallen down like the house, and  was almost turned to dust.	stern
3462	3462	He took a handful of it, pressed it to his opened lips, and breathed very hard. . . .	stern
3463	3463	The following day he asked the old woman, who had taken care of him, where the rice-floor was which stood in the grounds of Adinda's house.	stern
3464	3464	The woman rejoiced to hear him speak, and ran through the village to seek the floor.	stern
3465	3465	When she could point out the new proprietor to Saidjah, he followed her silently, and being brought to the rice-floor, he counted thereupon thirty-two lines. . . .	stern
3466	3466	Then he gave the woman as many piastres as were required to buy a buffalo, and left Badoer.	stern
3467	3467	At Tjilangkahan, he bought a fishing-boat, and, after having sailed two days, arrived in the Lampoons, where the insurgents were in insurrection against the Dutch rule.	stern
3468	3468	He joined a troop of Badoer men, not so much to fight as to seek Adinda ; for he had a tender heart, and was more disposed to sorrow than to bitterness.	stern
3469	3469	One day that the insurgents had been beaten, he wandered through a village that had just been taken by the Dutch army, and was therefore in flames.	stern
3470	3470	Saidjah knew that the troop that had been destroyed there consisted for the most part of Badoer men.	stern
3471	3471	He wandered like a ghost among the houses, which were not yet burned down, and found the corpse of Adinda's father with a  bayonet-wound in the breast.	stern
3472	3472	Near him Saiidjah saw the three murdered brothers of Adinda, still boys—children, —and a little further lay the corpse of Adinda, naked, and horribly mutilated. . . .	stern
3473	3473	A small piece of blue linen had penetrated into the gaping wound in the breast, which seemed to have made an end to a long struggle. . . .	stern
3474	3474	Then Saidjah went to meet some soldiers who were driving, at the point of the bayonet, the surviving insurgents into the fire of the burning houses ; he embraced the broad bayonets, pressed forward with all his might, and still repulsed the soldiers, with a last exertion, until their weapons were buried to the sockets in his breast.	stern
3475	3475	A little time afterwards there was much rejoicing at Batavia for the new victory, which so added to the laurels of the Dutch- Indian army.	stern
3476	3476	And the Governor wrote that tranquillity had been restored in the Lampoons ; the King of Holland, enlightened by his statesmen, again rewarded so much heroism with many orders of knighthood.	stern
3477	3477	"And probably thanksgivings mounted to heaven from the hearts of the saints in churches and tabernacles, at the news that "" the Lord of hosts "" had again fought under the banner of Holland. . . ."	stern
3478	3478	""" But God, moved with so much woe, Did not accept the sacrifices of that day ! ""  "	stern
3479	3479	I have made the end of the history of Saidjah shorter than I could have done if I had felt inclined to paint something dreary.	stern
3480	3480	The reader will have observed how I lingered over the description of the waiting under the Ketapan, as if I was afraid of the sad catastrophe, and how I glided over that with aversion.	stern
3481	3481	And yet that was not my intention, when I began to speak about Saidjah.	stern
3482	3482	For I feared that stronger colours were requisite to move when describing such strange circumstances.	stern
3483	3483	Yet while writing I felt that it would be an insult to the reader to believe that I ought to have put more blood in my picture I could have done it, for I have documents before me . . .	stern
3484	3484	but no !—rather a confession.	stern
3485	3485	Yes ! a confession.	stern
3486	3486	I do not know whether Saidjah loved Adinda: I know not whether he went to Badoer, nor whether he died in the Lampoons by Dutch bayonets.	stern
3487	3487	I do not know whether his father died by being beaten with rods, because he left Badoer without a passport, I do not know whether Adinda counted the moons by lines in her rice-floor.	stern
3488	3488	All this I do not know.	stern
3489	3489	But I know more than all this.	stern
3490	3490	I know, and I can prove it, that there were many Adindas and many Saidjahs, and that what was fiction in one case, becomes truth generally speaking.	stern
3491	3491	I have already said that I can give the names of persons who, like the parents of Saidjah and Adinda, were driven away by oppression from their  country.	stern
3492	3492	It is not my intention to publish in this book communications such as would be suitable for a tribunal that had to decide on the manner in which the Dutch power is exercised in India,---communications that would have the power to convince him only who had patience enough to read them all, which cannot be expected of the public that looks for recreation in its reading.	stern
3493	3493	Therefore instead of barren names of persons and places with the dates, instead of a copy of THE LIST OF THEFTS AND EXTORTIONS WHICH LIES BEFORE ME, I have tried to give a sketch of what can take place in the hearts of the poor people who are robbed of their means of subsistence ; or even, I have only made you guess this, as I feared to be mistaken in painting emotions which I never experienced.	stern
3494	3494	But as regards the main point ...	stern
3495	3495	O that I were summoned to prove what I wrote !	stern
3496	3496	"O that it were said, "" You invented that Saidjah : he never sang that lay ; there never lived an Adinda in Badoer !"	stern
3497	3497	O that it were said with the power and the will to do justice as soon as I have proved myself to have been no slanderer !	stern
3498	3498	Is there untruth in the parable of the Good Samaritan, because perhaps a plundered traveller was never taken to the Samaritan's house ?	stern
3499	3499	Is there untruth in the parable of the Sower, because it is clear that no husbandman will throw his seed on a rock ?	stern
3500	3500	"or, to descend to more conformity with my book, can the main thing---truth---be  denied to "" Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" because there never existed an Evangeline ?"	stern
3501	3501	"Shall people say to the author of that immortal protest---immortal, not because of art or talent, but because of tendency and impression---shall they say to her, "" You have lied : the slaves are not illtreated ; for there is untruth in your book—it is a novel ? """	stern
3502	3502	Had not she to give a tale, instead of an enumeration of barren facts, a tale which surrounded those facts, to introduce them into our hearts ?	stern
3503	3503	Would her book have been read if she had given it the form of a law-suit ?	stern
3504	3504	Is it her fault or mine, that truth, to find entrance, has so often to borrow the dress of a lie ?	stern
3505	3505	"And to some who will pretend that I have too much idealized Saidjah and his love, I ask how they can know this ; as only very few Europeans have given themselves the trouble to stoop to observe the emotions of the coffee and sugar machines, called "" Natives."""	stern
3506	3506	But even if this observation were well founded, whosoever quotes this as a proof against the cardinal tendency of my book, gives me a complete triumph.	stern
3507	3507	"For that observation when translated is as follows :—"" The evil which you combat does not exist, or not in such a high degree, because the native is not like your Saidjah : there is not in the ill-treatment of the Javanese so much evil as there would be if you had rightly drawn your Saidjah."	stern
3508	3508	The Soondanese do not sing such songs, do not love so, do not feel thus. . . .	stern
3509	3509	""" No, Colonial Ministers !"	stern
3510	3510	no, Governors-General in retirement !	stern
3511	3511	you have not to prove that.	stern
3512	3512	You have to prove that the population is not ill-treated, whether there are sentimental Saidjahs amongst this population or not ; or should you dare to pretend that you may steal buffaloes of men who do not love, who do not sing melancholy songs, who are not sentimental ?	stern
3513	3513	On an attack upon literary performances I should defend the exactness of the picture of Saidjah, but on political grounds I admit immediately all observations on this exactness, to prevent the great question from being removed to a wrong basis.	stern
3514	3514	It is quite indifferent to me whether I am thought to be an incapable painter, if it is only admitted that the ill-treatment of the native is EXCESSIVE ; that is the word on the notice of Havelaar's predecessor which he showed to the Controller Verbrugge: ---a notice which lies before me.	stern
3515	3515	But I have other proofs, and that is fortunate.	stern
3516	3516	For this predecessor of Havelaar could also have been mistaken.	stern
3517	3517	Alas, if he was mistaken, he has been very severely punished for his mistake !	stern
3518	3518	   Chapter XVIII   	stern
3519	3519	It was afternoon.	stern
3520	3520	Havelaar, coming out of his room, found Tine in the fore-gallery, waiting for him at the tea-table.	stern
3521	3521	Madam Slotering had just left her house, and seemed to have the intention of going to Havelaar's, but suddenly she went to the gate, and there, with very violent gestures, sent back a man who had just entered.	stern
3522	3522	She remained standing still till she felt sure that he had gone away, and then returned along the grass-field to Havelaar's.	stern
3523	3523	""" I will know at last what this means,"" said Havelaar ; and when the salutation was over he asked, jokingly, that she might not think he grudged her influence in grounds which formerly were hers : "" Now, Madam, do tell me why you always send back the men who come into the grounds."	stern
3524	3524	What if that man, for instance, had fowls to sell, or any other kitchen requisite?	stern
3525	3525	""" There was in the face of Madam Slotering a painful expression, which did not escape Havelaar's observation."	stern
3526	3526	""" Ah,"" she said, "" there are so many bad men."""	stern
3527	3527	""" Certainly, that is the case everywhere ; but if you are so particular, the good ones will stay away too."	stern
3528	3528	"Come now, Madam, tell me why you keep such a sharp look-out over the grounds?"""	stern
3529	3529	Havelaar looked at her, and endeavoured in vain to read the reply in her watery eyes.	stern
3530	3530	He again pressed for an explanation, and the widow burst into tears, saying that her husband had been poisoned at Parang-Koodjang, in the house of the district chief.	stern
3531	3531	"He would do justice, Mr. Havelaar !"" continued the poor woman ; "" he wished to put an end to the oppression of the people."	stern
3532	3532	He exhorted and threatened the chiefs in councils and in writing ; you must have found his letters in the archives ...	stern
3533	3533	""" That was the case : Havelaar had read those letters, of which I have copies before me. """	stern
3534	3534	"He spoke repeatedly to the Resident,"" continued the widow, "" but always in vain ; for as it was generally known that the extortion was for and under the protection of the Regent, whom the Resident would not complain of to the Government, all these conversations had no other effect than the ill treatment of the complainants."	stern
3535	3535	Therefore my poor husband had said that if no alteration should be made before the end of the year, he would apply direct to the Governor-General.	stern
3536	3536	That was in November.	stern
3537	3537	A few days later he made a journey of inspection, took his dinner  at the house of the Demang of Parang -Koodjang, and soon afterwards was brought home in a pitiable condition.	stern
3538	3538	"He cried, while pointing to his stomach, ' Fire, fire,' and in a few hours he was dead ; he who had always been remarkable for good health."""	stern
3539	3539	""" Did you send for the Serang doctor ?"" asked Havelaar."	stern
3540	3540	Yes, but my husband died soon after his arrival.	stern
3541	3541	I did not dare to tell the doctor my suspicion, because I foresaw that I should not be able soon to leave this place, and I feared revenge.	stern
3542	3542	I have heard that you, like my husband, oppose the abuses which reign here, and therefore I have not a moment's peace.	stern
3543	3543	I would have concealed all this from you to avoid frightening you and Madam Havelaar, and so I only watched the grounds to prevent strangers from entering the kitchen.	stern
3544	3544	""" Now it was clear to Tine why Madam Slotering had kept her own household, and would not even make use of the kitchen, which was so large."	stern
3545	3545	Havelaar sent for the Controller.	stern
3546	3546	Meanwhile he sent a request to the physician at Serang, to make a statement of the symptoms attending the death of Slotering.	stern
3547	3547	The reply which he received the next day to that request, was not in accordance with the widow's suspicions.	stern
3548	3548	"According to the doctor, Slotering had died of "" an abscess in the liver."	stern
3549	3549	""" I do not know whether such a disease can manifest itself suddenly, and cause death in a few hours."	stern
3550	3550	"I think I must bear in mind the evidence of Madam Slotering, that her husband had  formerly been always healthy ; but if no value is attached to such evidence, because the notion of what is called health varies with different persons, particularly in the eyes of non-medical individuals, yet the important question remains, whether a person who dies to-day of an "" abscess in the liver,"" could ride on horseback yesterday, with the intention of inspecting a mountainous country, which is in some directions eighty miles in extent ?"	stern
3551	3551	The doctor who treated Slotering may have been a skilful physician, and yet have been mistaken in his judgment of the symptoms of the disease, unprepared as he was to suspect crime.	stern
3552	3552	However this may be, I cannot prove that Havelaar's predecessor was poisoned, because Havelaar was not allowed time to clear up the matter ; but I can prove that every one believed in the poisoning, and that this was suspected on account of his desire to oppose injustice.	stern
3553	3553	"The Controller Verbrugge entered Havelaar's room ; the latter asked abruptly— "" What did Mr. Slotering die of?"""	stern
3554	3554	""" I don't know."""	stern
3555	3555	""" Was he poisoned ? """	stern
3556	3556	""" I don't know ; . . . ."	stern
3557	3557	"but---"" "" Speak plainly, Verbrugge."""	stern
3558	3558	""" But he endeavoured to oppose the abuses, as you do ...."	stern
3559	3559	and he would certainly have been poisoned if he had remained here longer.	stern
3560	3560	"""  "" Write that down !"""	stern
3561	3561	Verbrugge wrote it ....	stern
3562	3562	"it lies before me. """	stern
3563	3563	"To proceed, Is it true, or untrue, that much extortion is committed in Lebak?"""	stern
3564	3564	"Verbrugge made no reply. """	stern
3565	3565	"Answer me, Verbrugge !"""	stern
3566	3566	""" I dare not."""	stern
3567	3567	""" Write down that you dare not."""	stern
3568	3568	Verbrugge wrote it down ....	stern
3569	3569	"it lies before me. """	stern
3570	3570	Well, to proceed, you dare not answer the last question.	stern
3571	3571	"You told me lately, when there was a question about poisoning, that you were the only support of your sisters at Batavia,— is that the reason of your fear, of what I always called your halfness ?"""	stern
3572	3572	"""Yes."""	stern
3573	3573	Verbrugge wrote it down ....	stern
3574	3574	his declaration lies before me.	stern
3575	3575	""" That will do,"" said Havelaar, "" I know enough."	stern
3576	3576	And Verbrugge left.	stern
3577	3577	Havelaar went out and played with little Max, whom he kissed very fervently.	stern
3578	3578	When Madam Slotering was gone, he sent away the child, and called in Tine.	stern
3579	3579	""" Dear Tine !"	stern
3580	3580	I have a favour to ask you.	stern
3581	3581	"I should like you and Max to go to Batavia :—to-day I accuse the Regent."""	stern
3582	3582	"She fell on his neck, for the first time opposed to his wishes, and cried, sobbing—  ""No, Max ; no, Max, I will not go..."	stern
3583	3583	"I will not go ; we eat and drink together. """	stern
3584	3584	Was Havelaar wrong when he made out that she had as little right to blow her nose as the women at Arles?	stern
3585	3585	He wrote and despatched the letter of which I here present a copy.	stern
3586	3586	After I have given a slight sketch of the circumstances under which that letter was written, I believe that it is not necessary for me to show the circumspection which he observed, while not uttering a syllable of the discovery just made, not to weaken his positive accusation by the uncertainty of a very important	stern
3587	3587	but as yet unproved accusation.	stern
3588	3588	His intention was to exhume the corpse of his predecessor,and to havee it scientifically examined as soon as the Regent should have been removed, and his party made harmless ; but as I have already said, he was not allowed the opportunity of doing this.	stern
3589	3589	In the copies of official documents—copies which strictly conform with the originals—I think I may use single pronouns instead of the foolish titles.	stern
3590	3590	I expect that the good taste of my readers will approve of this change.	stern

3600	3600	""" In order conclusively to prove both these charges I "" take the liberty of proposing to you to order me— "" 1."	stern
3601	3601	"To send the Regent of Lebak with the utmost speed "" to Serang, and to take care that he shall not have occasion, "" either before his departure or during the journey, "" to influence by corruption, or in any other way, the "" witnesses."	stern
3602	3602	"I require, "" 2."	stern
3603	3603	"Previously to take the Demang of Parang-Koodjang "" into custody. "" 3."	stern
3604	3604	"To apply the same measure to such persons of  "" inferior rank as, belonging to the family of the Regent, "" may be expected to mar the impartiality of the examination to be instituted. """	stern
3605	3605	"To order that examination to take place immediately, and "" to report circumstantially on the issue."	stern
3606	3606	""" I take the liberty of submitting to your consideration "" the advisability of countermanding the visit of the "" Regent of Tjanjar. """	stern
3607	3607	"Finally, I have the honour to give you, as one who "" knows the district of Lebak better than it is as yet "" possible for me to know it, the assurance that, from a "" political point of view, the strictly just treatment of this "" affair has no difficulty at all, and that I should be rather "" apprehensive if it was not cleared up, for I am informed "" that the poor man is, as a witness told me, 'poessing' "" (tired, sick, disgusted) of all the vexation he has suffered, "" and that he has long sought relief."	stern
3608	3608	""" I have partly derived the strength to fulfil my difficult "" duty in writing this letter, from the hope that I may be "" allowed in due time to bring forward one or two excuses "" for the old Regent, for whose position, though caused by "" his own fault, I nevertheless feel great compassion."	stern
3609	3609	"— "" The Assistant Resident at Lebak, (Signed) "" Max Havelaar."	stern
3610	3610	""" The next day the Resident of Bantam replied ? . . . ."	stern
3611	3611	"no, but "" Mr. Slymering "" did so, in a private letter."	stern
3612	3612	That reply is a precious contribution to the knowledge  of how the Government is carried on in Dutch India.	stern
3613	3613	"Mr. Slymering complained "" that Havelaar had not first communicated verbally to him the affair mentioned in the letter"	stern
3614	3614	"88,""—of course because then there would have been more chance of ""arranging"" matters ; adding, more over, that Havelaar "" disturbed him in pressing business !"""	stern
3615	3615	The man was surely busy in writing the yearly report on tranquil tranquillity ....	stern
3616	3616	I have that letter before me, and do not trust my eyes.	stern
3617	3617	I read once more the letter of the Assistant Resident of Lebak ....	stern
3618	3618	I compare Havelaar and Slymering.	stern
3619	3619	This Shawlman is a low beggar.	stern
3620	3620	You must know, reader, that Bastianus is again very often absent from the office, because he has gout.	stern
3621	3621	Now, as I cannot reconcile it with my conscience to throw away the funds of the firm (Last and Co.)— for where principles are concerned, I am immoveable.	stern
3622	3622	I thought the day before yesterday that Shawlman wrote a good hand, and, as he looked so very poor, that he could therefore certainly be got for small wages.	stern
3623	3623	I therefore thought that it was my duty to provide in the cheapest manner for the removal of Bastianus.	stern
3624	3624	I went accordingly to Shawlman's house in the Lange Leidsche Dwarsstraat.	stern
3625	3625	The woman of the shop was at the door, but she seemed not to recognise me, though I  had lately told her that I was Mr. Drystubble, coffeebroker, of the Laurier Canal.	stern
3626	3626	There is always a sort of insult in such a non-recognition ; but as it was now not so cold, and as I wore last time I was there my coat trimmed with fur, I ascribed it to that, and think nothing of it—I mean the insult.	stern
3627	3627	I said therefore again that I was Mr. Drystubble, of the Laurier Canal, coffee-broker, and begged her to go and see if Shawlman was in, because I did not wish, as on the last occasion, to have to speak to his wife, who is always discontented.	stern
3628	3628	But the woman refused to go up -stairs.	stern
3629	3629	""" She could not walk up and down stairs the whole day for that beggarly family,"" said she, "" but I could go and look for myself."""	stern
3630	3630	And then followed again a description of the staircase and doors, which I had no need of ; for I always know a place where I have been once, because I pay such attention to everything.	stern
3631	3631	I have got accustomed to that in my business.	stern
3632	3632	So I went up-stairs, and knocked at the well-known door, which opened.	stern
3633	3633	I entered, and as I saw nobody in the room, I looked round.	stern
3634	3634	There was not much to be seen.	stern
3635	3635	A child's trousers with an embroidered stripe hung over a chair—why need such people wear embroidered trousers ?	stern
3636	3636	In a corner stood a not very heavy travelling box, which I lifted up by the hinge, and on the mantel-piece there were some books, which I looked at.	stern
3637	3637	A curious collection !	stern
3638	3638	A couple of volumes of Byron, Horace, Bastiat, Beranger, and, ... do guess ! . . .	stern
3639	3639	a Bible, a complete Bible, with  the Apocrypha.	stern
3640	3640	This I had not expected of Shawlman.	stern
3641	3641	It appeared also to have been read, for I found many notes on loose pieces of paper relating to the Scriptures, all written in the same handwriting as the pieces in that unwelcome parcel.	stern
3642	3642	Above all he seemed to have studied carefully the Book of Job, for there the leaves bore the marks of it.	stern
3643	3643	I think that he begins to feel the chastisement of the Lord, and will therefore reconcile himself to God by reading the Holy Scriptures, and I am not opposed to that.	stern
3644	3644	But while waiting, my eye caught sight of a lady's work-box which stood on the table.	stern
3645	3645	Without thinking about it, I looked at it : there were in it a pair of half-finished child's stockings, a lot of foolish verses, and a letter addressed to Shawlman's wife, as could be seen by the inscription.	stern
3646	3646	The letter was open, and it seemed as if it had been rumpled with some anger.	stern
3647	3647	Now it is a firm principle with me never to read anything that is not addressed to me, because I do not think it respectable.	stern
3648	3648	I never do such a thing when I have no interest in it ;—but now I got an inspiration that it was my duty to read this letter, because the contents would perhaps further me in the humane intentions that made me go to Shawlman.	stern
3649	3649	I thought about it, how the Lord is always near to those who believe in Him, as He gave me here quite unexpectedly an opportunity to know a little more about this man, and protected me too from the danger of performing an act of charity to an immoral person.	stern
3650	3650	I pay much attention to such directions of the Lord :— this has done me a great deal of good in business.	stern
3651	3651	With much surprise I saw that the wife of Shawlman belongs to a respectable family ; the letter at least was signed by a relation whose name in Holland is respected, and I was indeed in ecstasies with the beautiful contents of those lines.	stern
3652	3652	It appeared to be from a person who laboured zealously for the Lord ; for he wrote that the wife of Shawlman ought to be divorced from such a wretch, who made her suffer poverty,—who could not earn his livelihood, who was, moreover, a rascal, because he had debts.	stern
3653	3653	That the writer of the letter pitied her condition, though that condition was her own fault, because she had forsaken the Lord, and stuck to Shawlman ;—that she ought to return to the Lord, and that in that case her family would all of them assist her, and furnish her with needlework, but before all things she ought to put away this Shawlman, who was a disgrace to the family.	stern
3654	3654	In a word, you could not get in church itself more piety than was to be found in this letter.	stern
3655	3655	I knew enough, and was grateful to have been warned in such a miraculous way.	stern
3656	3656	Without this warning I should certainly have become a victim of my own good heart.	stern
3657	3657	I resolved, therefore, again to keep Bastianus till I could find a fitter person to take his place ; for I do not like to turn any one to the streets.	stern
3658	3658	The reader will be curious to know how I got on at the  	stern
3659	3659	Rosemeyers' last party.	stern
3660	3660	I was not there, .... wonderful things have happened !	stern
3661	3661	I had gone to Driebergen with my wife and Mary.	stern
3662	3662	My father-in-law, old Mr. Last, the son of the first Last (the Meyers were then still in the firm, but they have left it long ago), said some years ago that he should like to see my wife and Mary.	stern
3663	3663	Now, it was very fine weather, and my fear of the love-history with which Stern had menaced us, made me think all at once of this invitation.	stern
3664	3664	I spoke of it to our bookkeeper, who is a man of experience, and who, after mature deliberation, recommended me to sleep a night on it.	stern
3665	3665	This I intended immediately to carry out, for I am quick in the execution of my decisions.	stern
3666	3666	The following day I perceived already how wise this advice was, for during the night I got the idea that I could not do better than delay my decision till Friday.	stern
3667	3667	In a word, after having carefully considered all things,—there was much in favour of the plan, but also much against it,— we went on Saturday afternoon, and came back on Monday morning.	stern
3668	3668	I would not tell you all this, if it was not in connexion with my book.	stern
3669	3669	First of all I think it necessary that you should know why I do not protest against the nonsense which Stern certainly brought out last Sunday.	stern
3670	3670	(What nonsense is that about a person who would hear when he was dead ?	stern
3671	3671	Mary mentioned it to me : she had heard it from the Rosemeyers—who trade in sugar;) secondly, because I am now again convinced that all those stories about misery  and trouble in the East Indies are downright lies.	stern
3672	3672	Thus it may be seen how travelling gives a person the opportunity to penetrate deeply into affairs.	stern
3673	3673	Saturday evening, for instance, my father- in-law had accepted an invitation from a gentleman, who had been formerly a Resident in the East Indies, and who lives now at a large country-seat.	stern
3674	3674	We went there, and, indeed, I cannot sufficiently praise the excellent reception we met with.	stern
3675	3675	Our host sent his carriage to fetch us, and the coachman had on a red waistcoat.	stern
3676	3676	Now it was certainly a little too cold to inspect the country-seat, which must be magnificent in the summer, but in the house itself there was nothing to desire ; for it was replete with luxury: a billiard-room, a library, a covered iron and glass conservatory, and a cockatoo on a silver perch.	stern
3677	3677	I never saw such a thing.	stern
3678	3678	I made the observation, how good conduct is always rewarded ; that that man had been attentive to his business was evident, for he had more than three orders of knighthood.	stern
3679	3679	He had a beautiful country-seat, and, moreover, a house in Amsterdam.	stern
3680	3680	At the supper all was truffe, and even the servants who waited at table wore red waistcoats, like the coachman.	stern
3681	3681	As I take great interest in Indian affairs, because of the coffee, I began a conversation on the subject, and perceived very soon what I had to think about it.	stern
3682	3682	This Resident told me that he was always very well off in the East Indies, and that there was, therefore, not a word of  truth in those stories of discontent among the population.	stern
3683	3683	I turned the conversation upon Shawlman.	stern
3684	3684	He knew him, and that unfavourably.	stern
3685	3685	He said that the Government had done well in dismissing him, for that this Shawlman was a very discontented person, who made remarks about everything, and there was, moreover, much to disapprove of in his own conduct.	stern
3686	3686	For instance, he was always running away with girls, and bringing them home openly before his wife ; he did not pay his debts, a thing which is very unseemly.	stern
3687	3687	As I knew so exactly from the letter I had read how well-founded this accusation was, I was very well pleased to find that I had judged of all so correctly, and was quite satisfied with myself.	stern
3688	3688	I am also known for this at the Exchange-I mean for always possessing a sound judgment.	stern
3689	3689	This Resident and his wife were agreeable and kind.	stern
3690	3690	They told us much of their manner of life in the Indies : it must be very pleasant there.	stern
3691	3691	"They said that their country-seat near Driebergen was not half so large as what they called their "" grounds, "" in the interior of Java, and that a hundred men were required to keep it in order."	stern
3692	3692	But-and this is a proof of how they were liked-all this was done for nothing, and out of pure attachment.	stern
3693	3693	They told us also, that when they went away the sale of their furniture had produced a large profit, as it fetched ten times its value ; for that the native chiefs were all of them so fond of buying a keepsake of the Resident.  	stern
3694	3694	I told this afterwards to Stern, who maintained that this was done by coercion, and that he could prove it out of Shawlman's parcel ; but I told him that this Shawlman was a slanderer,—that he had run away with girls, like that young German at Busselinck and	stern
3695	3695	Waterman's,—that I did not attach the least value to his judgment, for that I had now learnt from a Resident himself how matters stood, and had therefore nothing to learn from Shawlman.	stern
3696	3696	There were still more persons from the Indies, amongst others a very rich gentleman, who had gained much money on tea, which the Javanese made him for little money, and which the Government bought from him for a high price, to encourage the activity of the Javanese.	stern
3697	3697	This gentleman was also very angry with all those discontented persons, who are always speaking and writing against the Government.	stern
3698	3698	He could not say enough in praise of the government of the Colonies ; for he said that he had the conviction that it lost a great deal in tea, which it bought from him, and that was therefore very generous in invariably paying such a high price for an article, intrinsically of little value, which he himself did not like, for he always drank Chinese tea.	stern
3699	3699	He said also, that the Governor-General, who had prolonged the so-called tea-contracts, notwithstanding the calculation that the nation lost so much on this, such a clever, good man was he, and, above all, a good friend of those who had known him formerly; for that this Governor-General had not paid  the least attention to the talk about losses on the tea,and had done him therefore a great deal of good by not cancelling those tea-contracts.	stern
3700	3700	Yes,” he went on, “ my heart bleeds, when I perceive that such noble persons are slandered : if he had not been there, I should have to walk with my wife and children .”	stern
3701	3701	Thereupon he ordered his carriage, and it looked so magnificent, and the horses were so beautiful and so fat,that I can understand why he is full of gratitude to such a Governor-General.	stern
3702	3702	It does one's heart good to behold such charming emotions, above all when comparing them with that accursed grumbling and complaining of persons like that Shawlman .	stern
3703	3703	The following day, the Resident and that gentleman for whom the Javanese make tea, returned our visit.	stern
3704	3704	Both of them at once asked us by what train we thought of going to Amsterdam .	stern
3705	3705	We did not know what this meant,but afterwards it was clear to us, for when we arrived there on Monday morning, there were two servants at the station, one with a red waistcoat, and one with a yellow one, who both at the same time told us that he had received an order by telegram , to fetch us in a carriage.	stern
3706	3706	My wife was confused, and I thought what would Busselinck and Waterman have said if they had seen that,--I mean that there were two carriages for us.	stern
3707	3707	But it was not easy to make a choice, for I could not resolve to hurt one of the parties by refusing such a nice  offer.	stern
3708	3708	Good advice was dear; but I came victorious out of this great difficulty.	stern
3709	3709	I put my wife and Mary in the red carriage, the red waistcoat I mean--- and I went in the yellow one,---I mean the carriage.	stern
3710	3710	How those horses tore along! on the Weesper Street where it is always so dirty, the mud flew as high as the houses, and there I saw the miserable Shawlman, his back bent, his head bowed down--and I saw how he tried to wipe the mud off his pale face with the sleeve of his threadbare coat.	stern
3711	3711	   Chapter XIX  	stern
3712	3712	In the private letter which Mr. Slymering sent to Havelaar, he communicated to him, that he, notwithstanding his pressing business, would come the next day to Rankas-Betong, to deliberate on what ought to be done.	stern
3713	3713	Havelaar, who knew what such a deliberation meant- his predecessor had so often deliberated with the Resident of Bantam - wrote the following letter,which he sent to meet the Resident, and be read by him before his arrival at Lebak :  “ 25th Feb. 1856, 11 P.M. “ Yesterday at 12 o'clock, I had the honour to send you my missive (Immediate, No. 88) containing in substance “ That I, after a long investigation, and after having tried in vain to bring back by moderation the party concerned from his perversity, felt myself obliged by my official oath to accuse the Regent of Lebak of abuse of power, and to add that I suspected him of extortion.	stern
3714	3714	"I have taken the liberty to propose to you in that letter, to summon that native chief to Serang, in order to examine after his departure, and after the corrupting influence of his extensive family had been neutralized, whether my accusation and suspicion were well founded. """	stern
3715	3715	"Long, or to speak more accurately, much have I reflected "" before determining upon this."	stern
3716	3716	""" I took care to let you know that I have endeavoured, "" by exhortation and threats, to save the old Regent from "" misfortune and shame, and myself from the deep regret "" of having been the immediate cause of his troubles. """	stern
3717	3717	"But on the other hand, I saw the (for many years) "" plundered and much oppressed population."	stern
3718	3718	"I thought of "" the necessity of an example—for I shall have to report "" to you many more vexations,—if, at least this affair, by "" its reaction makes no end of them,—and, I repeat it, "" after mature consideration, I did what I thought to be "" my duty."	stern
3719	3719	""" I have just received your kind and esteemed private "" letter communicating that you will come here to-morrow, "" and at the same time a hint that I ought to have treated "" this affair privately at first."	stern
3720	3720	"To-morrow I shall therefore "" have the honour to see you, and it is exactly on that "" account that I have taken the liberty to send you this  "" letter, to add, before our meeting, the following considerations :— "" All my investigations about the Regent were quite "" secret ; only he and the Patteh (Adjutant of the Regent) "" knew it, for I myself had frankly warned him."	stern
3721	3721	"Even the "" Controller knows only a part of my investigations."	stern
3722	3722	"This "" secrecy had a double aim."	stern
3723	3723	"At first when I still hoped to "" bring back the Regent to the right way, it was my object "" if I succeeded not to compromise him."	stern
3724	3724	"The Patteh "" thanked me in the name of the Regent for this discretion."	stern
3725	3725	(It was on the 12th inst.)	stern
3726	3726	But afterwards when I began to despair of the success of my endeavours,—or rather, when the measure of my indignation overflowed on hearing of a recent occurrence ; —when a longer silence would have become participation as an accomplice—then that secrecy would have been to my advantage ; for I too have to fulfil duties towards my household and myself.	stern
3727	3727	For after writing my letter of yesterday, I should be unworthy to serve the Government, if what I wrote down then was vain, unfounded, or invented.	stern
3728	3728	"And would or will it be possible to me to prove that I have done what a good Assistant Resident ought to do—to prove that I am "" not unworthy the functions which I have received ;— to "" prove that I do not risk thoughtlessly and rashly my seventeen "" hard years in the service of the Government, and, "" what is of more importance still, the interest of wife and "" child—will it be possible for me to prove all this, unless  "" deep secrecy does not hide my investigations, and prevent the "" criminal from concealing himself ?"	stern
3729	3729	""" At the least suspicion the Regent would send an express to his "" nephew, who is coming here, and whose "" interest it is to maintain him, at any sacrifice, and to  "" distribute money with a profuse hand to every one "" whom he had recently swindled, the consequence "" would be (I need not say will be) that I have passed a "" rash judgment, and am an unserviceable functionary, "" not to say worse. """	stern
3730	3730	To prevent that result I write this letter.	stern
3731	3731	"I have the "" highest esteem for you ; but I know the spirit of East "" Indian functionaries, and I do not possess that spirit."	stern
3732	3732	""" Your hint that it would have been better to have "" treated the affair privately at first, makes me apprehensive "" of such a course."	stern
3733	3733	"What I said in my missive of "" yesterday is true ; but perhaps it would seem untrue if "" the affair was treated in such a manner as would reveal "" my accusation and suspicion before the removal of the "" Regent."	stern
3734	3734	"I may not conceal from you that even your "" unexpected arrival in connexion with the express sent "" by me yesterday to Serang, gives me reason to fear that "" the accused, who would not listen to my exhortations, "" will now awake too soon, and endeavour, if possible, tant "" soit peu to exculpate himself."	stern
3735	3735	""" I have the honour to say that I still refer literally to "" my missive of yesterday ; but I take the liberty to  "" observe that this missive contained a proposal to remove "" the Regent before the investigation, and previously to "" make his adherents harmless ; and at the same time that "" I believe myself to be no further responsible for what I "" advanced,than so far as you may be pleased to agree to "" my proposition as regards the manner of investigation— "" that it should be impartial, open, and above all, free. """	stern
3736	3736	"This liberty cannot exist before the removal of the "" Regent ; and according to my humble opinion, there is "" nothing dangerous in that ; as he can be told that I "" accuse him and suspect him, that I am in danger, and "" not he, in the event of his innocence being established:— "" for I myself am of opinion that I ought to be dismissed, if "" it shall appear that I have acted precipitately or rashly. """	stern
3737	3737	Precipitately ! . . .	stern
3738	3738	"After years and years of abuses ! """	stern
3739	3739	"as if an honest man could sleep, and live, "" and enjoy, while they, over whose welfare he is called "" upon to watch, who are in the highest sense his neighbours, "" suffer extortion and injustice !"	stern
3740	3740	""" I have been here, it is true, but a short time."	stern
3741	3741	"I hope, "" however, that the question will for once be, what has "" been done, if anything has been well done, and not "" whether it has been done in too short a time."	stern
3742	3742	"For me, "" every moment is too long, when characterized by extortion "" and oppression, and every second weighs heavy on "" me that is passed in misery by my negligence, by my "" ' spirit of arranging.'"	stern
3743	3743	""" I regret the days which I allowed to pass away before "" reporting to you officially, and I apologize for that "" neglect."	stern
3744	3744	""" I have taken the liberty to request you to give me the "" opportunity to justify my letter of yesterday, and to "" guarantee me against the miscarriage of my endeavours "" to free the province of Lebak from the worms which "" have gnawed, since the memory of man, at its welfare."	stern
3745	3745	""" It is therefore that I have again taken the liberty of "" asking you to approve my action, which consists only of "" investigating, reporting, and proposing to remove the Regent "" of Lebak, without direct or indirect notice beforehand ; and "" moreover to order an investigation to take "" place of what I communicated in my letter of yesterday, "" No."	stern
3746	3746	"88.—The Assistant Resident of Lebak, (Signed) "" Max Havelaar."	stern
3747	3747	This request, not to take the criminals under his protection, the Resident received on the way.	stern
3748	3748	"An hour after his arrival at Rankas-Betong, he paid a visit to the Regent, and asked him whether he could "" say anything to the prejudice of the Assistant Resident,"" and whether he, the Regent, "" wanted money."""	stern
3749	3749	"To the first question the Regent replied, "" I have nothing against him !"	stern
3750	3750	"I can solemnly swear to that ! """	stern
3751	3751	The second question he answered in the affirmative, whereupon the Resident gave him a couple of bank-notes.	stern
3752	3752	It may be understood that Havelaar knew nothing of this.	stern
3753	3753	We shall see by and by how he became acquainted with so shameful a transaction.	stern
3754	3754	When the Resident Slymering entered Havelaar's house, he was paler than usual, and the intervals between his words were longer than ever.	stern
3755	3755	"It was indeed no small thing for a person who so excelled in arranging and making out the yearly reports of "" tranquillity,"" to receive so unexpectedly letters in which there was no trace either of optimism or of artificial colouring, or of fear of the disapprobation of the Government."	stern
3756	3756	The Resident of Bantam was in a fright ; and if I may be forgiven the ignoble comparison for the sake of exactness, I feel inclined to liken him to a little street-boy who complains of the violation of old customs, because he has been beaten without previous abusive language.	stern
3757	3757	He began by asking the Controller why the latter had not endeavoured to restrain Havelaar from his accusation ?	stern
3758	3758	Poor Verbrugge, who was entirely unacquainted with the circumstances, said so, but was not believed.	stern
3759	3759	Mr. Slymering could not believe that any person without assistance could do his duty in such a manner.	stern
3760	3760	As Verbrugge, however, maintained his ignorance, the Resident began to read Havelaar's letters.	stern
3761	3761	What Verbrugge suffered in listening is indescribable.	stern
3762	3762	He was an honest man, and would not have lied if Havelaar had appealed to him to confirm the truth of the contents of these letters.	stern
3763	3763	But even without that honesty, he had not always been able to avoid the truth in many written reports, even where it was dangerous to tell it.	stern
3764	3764	How would it be if Havelaar made use of those reports?	stern
3765	3765	After having read these letters, the Resident said that, if Havelaar chose to recall these documents, it would be agreeable to him to consider them as not written, which Havelaar firmly but politely refused.	stern
3766	3766	Having in vain tried to move him to this, the Resident said that he must investigate the charges, and that he had therefore to request Havelaar to summon the witnesses in support of the accusation he had brought against the Regent.	stern
3767	3767	Ye poor creatures, whose sides had been wounded by the thorns in the ravine, how anxiously would your hearts have beaten if you could have heard this request !	stern
3768	3768	And you, poor Verbrugge, you first witness, chief witness, ex officio witness, a witness in virtue of office and oath, a witness who had already borne witness on paper, which lay there on the table under Havelaar's hand ! . . . .	stern
3769	3769	"Havelaar replied :— "" Mr. Resident,—I am Assistant Resident of Lebak ; I have promised to protect the population from extortion and tyranny ; I accuse the Regent and his son-in-law of Parang-Koodjang ; I will prove my accusation as soon as that opportunity is given me, which I proposed in  my letters."	stern
3770	3770	"I am guilty of slander if this accusation is false!"""	stern
3771	3771	How freely Verbrugge breathed again !	stern
3772	3772	And how strange the Resident thought Havelaar's words.	stern
3773	3773	The conversation lasted long.	stern
3774	3774	With politeness,— for Slymering was polite and well-bred,—he urged Havelaar to turn aside from such wrong principles ; but with as much politeness the latter remained immoveable.	stern
3775	3775	The result was, that the Resident had to yield, in saying as a threat, what was to Havelaar a victory, that he should be compelled to bring the matter under the notice of the Government.	stern
3776	3776	The meeting was ended.	stern
3777	3777	"The Resident paid the visit to the Regent, to put to him the questions already mentioned, and then dined at the scanty board of the Havelaars, after which he returned in great haste to Serang, "" because---he---had---still--- so---much---to---do."	stern
3778	3778	""" The next day Havelaar received a letter from the Resident of Bantam, the contents of which may be understood from the reply, of which I here give a copy :—  "" No. 93.—Private. """	stern
3779	3779	RANKAS-BETONG, 28th February 1856.	stern
3780	3780	""" I have had the honour to receive your missive of the "" 26th inst."	stern
3781	3781	"(La. O, private), containing mainly the following :—  "" That you had reasons for not accepting the proposals "" made in both my official letters of the 24th and 25th '' inst.,"	stern
3782	3782	"Nos. 88 and 91 ; "" That you had desired a previous confidential communication ; "" That you do not approve of my transactions described "" in both those letters ; "" And lastly, some orders."	stern
3783	3783	""" I have now the honour again to assert, as I did verbally in the meeting of the day before yesterday :— "" That I fully respect the legality of your power as regards deciding whether to accept my proposition or "" not :— "" That the orders received shall with exactness be "" obeyed— with self-sacrifice, if need be, as if you were "" present to witness all I do or say, or, more properly, all "" I do not do or do not say."	stern
3784	3784	""" I know that you place confidence in my good faith in "" this matter. """	stern
3785	3785	"But I take the liberty solemnly to protest against the "" least semblance of disapprobation of any action, any "" word, any phrase, done, spoken, or written by me in this "" matter."	stern
3786	3786	"I am convinced that I have done my duty :— "" in my object and in the manner of executing it quite my "" duty ;—nothing but my duty, without the least deviation."	stern
3787	3787	""" I have long pondered before acting (that is : before "" examining, reporting, and proposing), and if I have been  "" to a certain extent mistaken in anything,—my fault was "" not precipitancy."	stern
3788	3788	In the same circumstances I should do again-yet a little quicker -exactly, exactly the same.	stern
3789	3789	""" Even if it happened that a higher power than yours "" disapproved anything which I did,—(except perhaps the "" peculiarity of my style, which is a part of myself, a defect for which I am as little responsible as a stammerer for his defect ;)—even if that happened .... but no, that cannot be, even if it were so, ...."	stern
3790	3790	"I have done my duty. """	stern
3791	3791	"Certainly I am sorry—yet without being astonished, —that you judge differently of this ; and as far as regards myself, I should rely upon what appears to me to "" be a slight-but there is a question about a principle, "" and I have conscientious reasons which require that it "" shall be decided which opinion is correct, yours or mine."	stern
3792	3792	Serve otherwise than I served at Lebak, I cannot.	stern
3793	3793	""" If the Government desires to be served otherwise, then "" I shall be obliged as an honest man to ask the Government "" to discharge me ;—then I must endeavour, at the age of "" thirty-six years, to commence a new career ;—then I, "" after seventeen years, after seventeen heavy difficult "" years of service as a functionary, after having devoted "" the best of my lifetime to what I considered to be my "" duty, then I must again ask society for bread, if it will "" give me bread, for my wife and child—bread in exchange  "" for thoughts—bread perhaps in exchange for labour with "" spade or wheelbarrow, if the strength of my arm is approved more than that of my soul, ''"	stern
3794	3794	"But I cannot and will not believe that your opinion is "" shared by his Excellency the Governor-General, and I "" am therefore compelled, before I pass to the bitter extreme of what I wrote in the last paragraph, to beg you "" respectfully to propose to the Government : "" To order the Resident of Bantam to approve so far the "" transactions of the Assistant Resident of Lebak, including "" his letters of the 24th and 25th inst.,"	stern
3795	3795	"Nos. 88 and 91 ;— "" Or: "" To call the above-mentioned Assistant Resident to "" account on the points of disapprobation to be given by "" the Resident of Bantam."	stern
3796	3796	""" I have, finally, the honour to give you the grateful "" assurance that if anything could bring me back from my  long calculated, and calm but fervently adhered to principles in this,—it would have been indeed the polite, engaging manner in which you, at the meeting of the day before yesterday, opposed those principles.—The "" Assistant Resident of Lebak, (Signed)  "" Max Havelaar."""	stern
